Land use is a crucial factor affecting ecosystem service value (ESV), and forecasting future land use changes and
ESV response can guide urban planning and sustainable development decisions. However, the traditional Cellular
Automata (CA) model supposes that each cell has only one land use type at each time step, neglects the mixed
structure and proportional distribution of land use units, does not take into account its quantitative continuous
dynamic change, and lacks the exploration of land use quantity structure and spatial pattern optimization. This
study employed a novel mixed-cell cellular automata (MCCA) approach, coupled with the system dynamics (SD)
model to predict the spatiotemporal pattern of land use under the natural increase scenario (NIS), economic
development scenario (EDS) and ecological protection scenario (EPS) in Xi’an, China, in 2030. The equivalent
coefficient method was utilized to investigate the heterogeneity distribution and sensitivity of ESV. The results
demonstrated that SD-MCCA exhibited remarkable prediction accuracy and robustness. The main changes in land
use in 2000–2015 were due to urban expansion, the conversion of arable land into construction land, and the
conversion between grassland and arable land. The total ESV increased from 19554.36×106 CNY in 2000 to
19618.39×106 CNY under the EPS in 2030, and the contribution of climate regulation and hydrological regu­
lation to ESV was the highest. Spatial heterogeneity of ESV revealed a certain regularity, and the high value
region was chiefly concentrated in woodland and grassland with favorable ecological conditions. Land use
variations under NIS and EPS improved ESV, while the ESV had a negative response to land use transformations
under the EDS. This research provides a new way to identify the relationship between future land utilization
scenarios and ESV, which is of great significance for the management of land resources and formulation of
ecological compensation standards.

1. Introduction
Ecosystem service (ES) refers to the benefits that human beings
obtain directly or indirectly from the structure, process and function of
ecosystems, mainly includes provisioning, cultural, regulating and
supporting services (Costanza et al., 1997; de Groot et al., 2010; Zhang
et al., 2020). Monetary assessment of ecosystem service value (ESV) can
effectively quantify the benefits that humans derive from the ecosystem,
improve people’s understanding of the value of natural assets, help

decision makers carry out reasonable ecological environment planning,
promote regional scientific development and protect ecosystems with
high ESVs (Bateman et al., 2013; Fisher et al., 2009; Pueffel et al., 2018).
However, with the acceleration of economic development, population
growth and urban sprawl, human activities have led to ecosystem
degradation, biodiversity reduction and water quality deterioration,
further contributing to significant decreases in ESVs (Collin and Melloul,
2001). Land utilization variation is a key index that reflects anthropo­
genic disturbance to the ecosystem and has significant role in supporting

ES functions. Nevertheless, human overexploitation of land resources
has resulted in serious damage to regional ecosystems (Keller et al.,
1991). Therefore, exploring the relationship between ESV and land use
variations is extremely important for maintaining ecosystem health and
the sustainable utilization of land resources (Aziz, 2021; MendozaGonzalez et al., 2012).
In recent years, the response of ESV to land utilization change has
attracted increasing attention from researchers in China and abroad
(Arowolo et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2021b). In southern
Sinaola, Mexico, researchers applied remote sensing technology to
assess the impact of land use transformation on wetland ESV from 2000
to 2010 (Camacho-Valdez et al., 2014). Kindu et al. (2016) revealed
influence of land use dynamics on ESV in Ethiopian highlands from 1973
to 2012 and investigated the contribution differences of different
ecosystem service functions. Some researchers have examined the
response of ESV in the Pearl River Delta of China to land use trans­
formation through multisource data and detected hot and cold spots (Hu
et al., 2019). Dai et al. (2021) verified the distribution features of land
utilization and ESV in Chengdu, China, utilized remote sensing images
from 2003 to 2018, and further discussed the driving factors of ESV.
Akhtar et al. (2022) assessed the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of ESV
in dryland ecosystems of Pakistan by combining land use data and GIS
analysis techniques and evaluated the causes of ESV reduction. How­
ever, previous studies mostly employed historical land use for ESV
estimation, and there is still room for investigation into the potential
future trend of ESV. The prediction of future land use scenarios and ESV
responses can offer a scientific reference for government land planning
decisions and ecosystem protection (Peng et al., 2021; Schirpke et al.,
2020; Zhang et al., 2015).
Land use models are often applied to forecast the spatiotemporal
distribution of ESV with land use conversions (Liu et al., 2021a; Qin and
Fu, 2020; Zhang et al., 2019). Das et al. (Das et al., 2021) adopted
machine learning and the cellular automata (CA)-Markov model to
predict the spatial allocation of ESV in Asian megacities from 2030 to
2050 and clarified the spatial aggregation pattern of ESV. Wu et al.
(2020) coupled a linear optimizing technique and the conversion of land
use and its effects at a small regional extent (CLUE-S) and assessed the
response of ESV to land utilization planning scenarios in 2025. Liu et al.
(2020) employed the future land use simulation (FLUS) model to reveal
the dynamic evolution of ESV under the scenarios of natural growth,
economic growth and ecological conservation in the Bohai Rim coastal
region. These researchers integrated multipurpose optimal method and
the patch-generating land-use simulation (PLUS) model to evaluate
temporal and spatial alterations of ESV in ecological shelter zone in
China in 2026 (Li et al., 2021). However, these conventional models
hypothesize that every cell is pure and discrete (Pontius et al., 2007). In
reality, each cell consists of a mixture of various land utilization types.
The mixed-cell cellular automata (MCCA) model can simulate the pro­
portional distribution of mixed land utilization patterns in cells, exca­
vate land use development probability using the random forest (RF)
algorithm, and simulate the land use competition mechanism based on
multiple roulettes. It can realize the mutual transformation of various
land utilization structures at subcellular level and has a higher precision
in land application simulation (Liang et al., 2021). Therefore, MCCA
approach is a new and effective approach for the multi-scenario
modeling of land utilization and future forecasting of ESV.
The combination of land use spatial prediction and quantitative
structure simulation model can reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics
and internal mechanism of land utilization change, and can more
accurately simulate the spatial distribution of land application and ESV
(Wang et al., 2022b). Wang et al. (2022a) combined multi-criteria
evaluation (MCE) and CA model to predict the spatial and temporal
changes of land utilization in Wuhan metropolitan area. Li et al. (2019)
integrated Markov and CA to demonstrated the influence of land utili­
zation alterations on ESV in Central Asia from 2025 to 2035. Wang et al.
(2018b) established three various of land use scenarios using the multi-

objective programming (MOP) and CLUE-S model, and investigated the
response law of ESV in Wuhan in 2040. However, the nonlinear influ­
ence of socio-economic factors on the quantitative structure of land
application has been neglected, and the optimization of the quantitative
structure of land utilization has not been considered. SD model can solve
the internal feedback between the structure, function and behavior of
land utilization, gain the dynamic quantitative information of the sys­
tem (Letourneau et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2012), and illuminate the
nonlinear correlation mechanism between the socio-economic system
and land application in accordance with the construction table function
(van Delden et al., 2010), achieve the quantitative structure prediction
of land utilization types under varying scenarios in the future.
Combining the macro area demand forecast of SD with the micro spatial
modeling of MCCA can give full play to the complementary advantages
of the coupling model SD-MCCA and enhance the precision of the
simulation results of ESV and land application spatial-temporal pattern
(Rasmussen et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2022).
The approaches for evaluating ESV are divided into two types: the
price each unit ES function and the equivalent coefficient technique in
accordance with land use value each unit area (Fu et al., 2022). The
previous approach utilizes ecological process models to quantify ESV
with comprehensive considerations (Elmqvist et al., 2015). However, it
requires too much input data, and the simulation process is too complex,
which requires multiple models to participate in the evaluation. It is
difficult to unify the standards, which raises the difficulty of its
employment and restricts its utilization in research (Liu et al., 2021b;
Long et al., 2022). In contrast, the latter method has the advantages of
simple operation, a lower data requirement intuitiveness and efficiency
and is widely applied in the simulation and prediction of ESV (Bateman
et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2021), which can provide support for the
calculation of ESV and aid in scientific decision-making.
Xi’an is the core area of the Xi’an Metropolitan Region and the key
zone of the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration (GPUA), as well as a
significant central city in western region of China. It is in a period of
accelerated industrialization and urbanization and inevitably faces a
variety of ecological and environmental problems (Zhang et al., 2021).
Therefore, the coordinated development of its regional ecological
economy has important theoretical significance and practical value for
the rational allocation of land resources and the sustainable manage­
ment of its ecosystems. In summary, the purposes of this research are as
follows: (1) to validate the simulation accuracy of the MCCA model by
combining the land use and driving forces from 2000 to 2015, integrate
socio-economic, population change and land use variables to establish
SD model, and the quantitative structure and spatial pattern prediction
optimization model SD-MCCA was coupled to predict the land use
spatial pattern in Xi’an in 2030 under the NIS, EDS and EPS scenarios;
(2) to reveal the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of ESV by
employing the equivalent coefficient method; and (3) to evaluate the
response of ESV to land utilization transformation by applying the
sensitivity index. This study provides new insights into the optimization
of land utilization quantity structure and pattern layout, and offers
policy recommendations for sustainable land resource planning, natural
resource protection and ecosystem management.

climate changes significantly in the four seasons. It is the largest key
metropolis in Northwest China. In February 2018, the Chinese govern­
ment released the GPUA expansion program, which clearly supports
Xi’an in building a national pivotal metropolis and an internationalized
city with historical and cultural characteristics.

which provided reference for sustainable development and scientific
management of ecosystem services in Xi’an.
3.1. Data sources and treatment
The Resource and Environmental Science Data Center of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences provides land utilization and administrative
boundaries in 2000 and 2015, the data accuracy is 30 m, in which land
use include cultivated land, woodland, grassland, water area, built-up
area and bare land. It also offers NDVI, social and economic in­
dicators, and the data precision is 1000 m. The digital elevation model
(DEM) with accuracy of 30 m is obtained through the geospatial data
cloud platform, from which slope and aspect data were extracted. The
Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) provided soil data, meteo­
rological data retrieved from the China Meteorological Data Network,
containing precipitation and temperature. The distance to the way and
administrative center were calculated in ArcGIS (European distance).
The earth night light “flint” data set provided night light data at a res­
olution of 1500 m. Statistical data of Xi’an provided the area and yield of
crops. Xi’an Statistical Yearbook and General Land Use Planning from
1978 to 2015 were collected to provide the socio-economic and de­
mographic for the SD model. The raster data used in the study were
resampled to the same resolution.

3. Materials and methods
In this research, we coupled a new mixed land use structure MCCA
model and system dynamics SD model to investigate the optimization
approach of land utilization quantitative structure and spatial pattern,
predict the spatiotemporal evolution rule of land application in the
future, and reveal the response mechanism of ESV under multiple sce­
narios. The framework included the following three steps (Fig. 2): (1)
Database establishment. In accordance with the requirements of SDMCCA model, the acquired data is preprocessed, and the historical
land utilization data is transformed into mixed cell data. The driving
factors are extracted, interpolated and resampled to the same boundary
and resolution. (2) Model coupling. The past land application mixed cell
data and driving forces are employed to forecast the conversion matrix
and development probability data set, simulate the land utilization
alteration in 2015, and verify the precision of the SD-MCCA model.
According to population variation, socio-economic and policy orienta­
tion, the area and space pattern of various land application types under
different scenarios in 2030 are predicted. (3) Future ESV prediction. The
value table of ecosystem services per unit area was built by applying the
yield and value coefficient of primary grain crops. The spatiotemporal
distribution of ESV under various scenarios was evaluated on the basis of
the equivalent coefficient method. The sensitivity index was applied to
demonstrate the impact of land application transformation on ESV,

3.2. MCCA model
To predict future multi-scenario changes in land use, a novel mixed
cell MCCA model was adopted (Liang et al., 2021). This is a new CA
model founded on quantitative conversion rule mining of land use types,
land use structure simulation and accuracy evaluation, which is

employed to reveal diversity of land utilization structure and describe
land use structure variation more accurately (Fig. 3). Quantitative
conversion rule mining of land utilization patterns is utilized to confirm
the impact of driving factors on different land utilization composition
and obtain the evolution probability. The driving forces were selected
from two aspects of natural and social factors. Considering the interac­
tion between pixels and the internal information of pixels, the adaptive
chance of different land utilization components was calculated by using
random forest algorithm. The modeling of land utilization structure by
using MCCA’s pixel state, which is composed of a series of components
and their interaction relationships within the pixel. We applied roulette
wheel to confirm whether the land utilization transformation reaches
the expected goal to meet the macro land use demand and micro land
application competition. The feedback between land utilization requests
and configurations is used to finally achieve the predicted target. The
traditional simulation accuracy assessment method is only suitable for
the pure CA model, it is difficult to evaluate consecutive and many di­
mensions indicators. Therefore, a scheme for MCCA accuracy estimation
is designed, which includes three parts: (1) RF is exploited to excavate
the conversion relation between land utilization structures and impact
indicators; (2) structural changes are quantitatively simulated according
to transition rules; and (3) the modeling precision is evaluated according
to three accuracy indexes (OA, mcFoM and average RE).

general land utilization planning of Xi’an from 1978 to 2015, the data of
social economy, population alteration and land application were ob­
tained. The SD model (Fig. 4) was established by using Vensim software.
The model simulation period was 2000–2030, and the time step was 1
year. The simulation process was divided into two steps (Wang et al.,
2022b). The first step is to utilize the collected historical data to examine
the model. By modifying the parameter settings, compare the modeling
results with the actual situation to ensure that the constructed model has
sufficient precision to simulate the land utilization require in the future
with multiple scenarios. The corresponding time period is 2000–2015.
The second step is to take into account human activities, policy trends
and scenario demands at the same time, regulate the system parameters
to acquire the land application requirements under various future sce­
narios for the next land utilization model simulation, and the corre­
sponding time period is 2015–2030.
3.4. Future scenario setting
To reveal different patterns of urban development in the future, we
set three alternative scenarios founded on SD model, namely NIS, EDS
and EPS, according to the overall land use planning in Xi’an and with
reference to the land use, ecological environment and economic growth
of the study area.
The NIS was a benchmark scenario, and the urban future develop­
ment pattern was consistent with the historical land use variation trend
under this scenario. According to the land utilization data, socioeconomic and demographic change factors from 2000 to 2015, the SD
model is applied to calculate the required area of each land utilization
type in 2030. The EDS prioritizes rapid economic development, the
population growth rate increased by 10 %, the proportion of urban
residents increased by 14 %, the grain yield per unit area increased by 2
% year by year, and the output of construction industry was the highest
under three scenarios. The EPS prioritizes ecological benefits; it focuses
on protecting land, such as forest cover, grassland and water bodies with

3.3. The SD model
The SD model can reflect the interaction between the functions and
dynamic behaviors of the components in the nonlinear dynamic varia­
tions of the complex system structure with multiple feedbacks. Its
advantage lies in the simplification and abstraction of the actual system
structure to adapt to diverse policy scenarios and propose corresponding
solutions (Huang et al., 2022), a feedback loop is formed during the
operation of the model to effectively investigate the dynamic evolution
mechanism behind the system. According to the statistical yearbook and

Fig. 4. SD model structure diagram.
5

ecological land areas of at least 5205 km2, for ecological use; the de­
mand for construction land decreased, and the per capita housing
requirement area decreased by 8 %; protecting capital arable land;
reducing the adverse impact of the disorderly extension of urban space
on the ecosystem; and prohibiting development in nature reserves and
national parks.

3.7. CLUE-S and CA-Markov model
CLUE-S is a predictive and visual land utilization alteration model
developed by Wageningen University in the Netherlands. It iteratively
achieves the spatial allocation of land application by calculating the
relationship between driving forces and land types (Verburg and Over­
mars, 2009). The model is composed of two independent parts: nonspatial demand module and spatial allocation module. The non-spatial
demand module operates independently of the model. It is necessary
to employ mathematical tools such as SPSS to determine the rationality
of selected land requirement, land policy and transfer restriction area
(Liao et al., 2022). The spatial allocation module calculates the land
utilization conversion probability in accordance with the input grid
data, and allocates the land application demand in the simulated year in
line with the obtained probability. The iterative process is applied to
achieve the target demand of each land utilization variety. In order to
execute higher simulation precision, it is necessary to enhance the
conversion elasticity and transfer matrix through relevant professional
knowledge, experience and multiple tests (Peng et al., 2021).
The CA-Markov model is developed on the grounds of the Markov.
The Markov can only effectively simulate the quantitative relationship
of land utilization variation, and has limited utility in space assignment.
The state at any time node in the alteration process only relies on the
results before this time point, that is, there is no aftereffect (Mokarram
et al., 2021). The CA model can generate transformation rules in view of
driving factors and land utilization data. The Markov model coupled
with the CA model not only retains the superiority of accurate forecast of
Markov model in long time series, but also integrates the benefits of CA
model in simulating complex spatial and temporal alterations, and adds
geospatial significance to the forecasting results of Markov model (Sun
et al., 2021). The IDRISI software developed by Clark Lab is employed to
generate the land utilization transfer matrix on the basis of the land
application data of the two phases, and then the adaptive probability
atlas is generated through the CA circular utilization driving force and
land utilization information to effectively forecast the future land
application variation (Zhao et al., 2019).

3.5. Assessment of ESV
The equivalent coefficient method was extensive applied in ESV
evaluation owing to its simplicity, efficiency and applicability (Costanza
et al., 1997). Xie et al. (2017) revised the equivalent coefficient of
different ecosystems, its value was determined to be equal to 1/7 of the
market value of the average grain output of that year. Consequently, the
value coefficient of the ecosystem per unit area is obtained applying the
following formulas:
VC =

1∑n Pi × Qi
7 i=1 M

(1)

where VC is the worth of the ES equivalence factor per elemental area
(CNY/ha), i refers to the kind of crop (consists of maize, wheat and
rapeseed), Pi means the average market value of agricultural products
(CNY/t), Qi refers output of agricultural products per elemental area (t/
ha/a), and M means overall sown acreage (ha).
(2)

VCi,j = eij × VC

where ei,j is the equivalent worth per elemental area of ES and VCi,j is the
value coefficient of different land utilization sorts and different ES fea­
tures (CNY/ha).
Various land utilization sorts, ES features and total ESVs were
calculated by the following formulas:

where ESVi is the ESV of land utilization form i, ESVj is the ESV of ES j,
ESV is the general ESV, and Ai is the acreage of land utilization type i.

To accurately assess the precision of the MCCA model, we used the
land use in 2000 as the benchmark graph and obtained the simulation
results of the space pattern of land utilization in 2015 by inputting
change probability, conversion rules, demand module, spatial con­
straints and simulation parameters of land application data in
2000–2015, as well as the driving factors such as geography, climate and
socioeconomic. OA (0.9834), mcFoM (0.27) and average RE (0.574)
were adopted to validate the similarity between mimetic and real land
utilization configuration. Fig. 5 reveals that the real and mimetic land
utilization configurations are similar in most regions, but the areas with
significantly different patterns were mainly located around cities, at the
boundaries of districts and counties, and along the routes of new roads.
In general, the simulation results of the MCCA model are reliable and
acceptable and can be employed to predict the NIS, EDS and EPS in
2030.
The SD model has been debugged and operated normally, which
means that there is no logical error in the formula construction.
Comparing the results of the simulated land utilization quantity in 2015
obtained by the model with the actual situation in 2015, the relative
error between the simulated and actual quantity of each land utilization
type is less than 1.3 %, which proves that the quantitative relationship
obtained by the SD model simulation can be utilized to forecast multiple
scenarios in 2030, and the model has high precision. It illustrates that
SD-MCCA model can be applied for future land use scenarios prediction
and ESV evaluation.

3.6. Sensitivity index of ESV
The response of ESV to land utilization transformation was analyzed
by the sensitivity indicators (SI) (Song and Deng, 2017), which can
measure the impact of 1 % land utilization transformation on ESV. The
larger the absolute value of SI is, the more obvious the influence of land
utilization transformation on ESV is. A positive SI demonstrates that
land utilization transformation improves ESV, while a negative SI sug­
gests that land utilization transformation plays a role in reducing ESV.

4.2. Spatiotemporal characteristics of land utilization variations

maximum growth of construction land occurs in the EDS, but the area of
cropland, wood land and bare land is the lowest in the three future
prediction scenarios. On the premise of ensuring sufficient arable land to
guarantee food production, arable land, grassland and unused land were
reduced by 14.91 %, 2.36 % and 9.28 %, respectively. Under the EPS,
the acreage of built-up area was the slowest, increased by 357.36 km2,
but the area of forest cover reached a maximum of 3072.91 km2 among
the three scenarios. The area of arable land was less than that in the NIS
but higher than that in the EDS, indicating that the implementation of
the ecological protection policy has restrained urban sprawl and
strengthened protection of arable land.

4.2.1. Investigation of land application transformations in Xi’an during
2000–2015
Fig. 6 shows the spatial distribution of land utilization in Xi’an in
2000–2015 and reveals the evolution characteristics of various land use
types with a Sankey diagram. From the perspective of spatial variation,
the land use indicated significant heterogeneity in 2000 and 2015, and
construction land was mainly located in the central regions, demon­
strating a trend of rapid urban expansion. The arable land was mainly
distributed around the built-up area, and the occupation of built-up area
was the chief cause of decrease. The forest cover and meadowland areas
were mainly located at south and southeast zones, and water bodies and
unused land were sparsely distributed. The Sankey diagram emphasized
that land utilization transformation pattern during 2000–2015 was
primarily the transfer between arable land and construction land. Area
of construction land converted from arable land was 438.84 km2, ac­
counting for 34.29 % of the area of construction land. The second reason
for the decrease was the mutual transformation between arable land and
grassland; the area from grassland to arable land was 60.54 km2, ac­
counting for 1.72 %.

4.3. Changes in ESV from 2000 to 2030
4.3.1. Temporal estimation in ESV
From 2000 to 2030, the ESV in Xi’an demonstrated a tendency of first
rising, then falling and finally growing again, with an overall increasing
trend (Table 1 and Table 2). The highest ESV under the EPS was largely
due to the protection and restoration of ecological land and the re­
striction of disorderly urban sprawl, while the lowest ESV under the EDS
was mainly driven by the acceleration of industrialization and urbani­
zation and the continuous expansion of the scale of construction land.
From 2000 to 2015, the total ESV increased, with a gain of 1.32×106
CNY, and further increased by 3.29×106 CNY and 62.72×106 CNY in
NIS and EPS during 2015–2030; however, the general ESV for EDS
decreased sharply, reduced by 321.85×106 CNY, indicating that urban
expansion has a serious negative influence on ESV. Forest cover, grass­
land and water bodies had the highest contributions of 88.84 % − 91.42

ESV of arable land and grassland revealed decreasing trends in
2000–2015, while the ESV of forest cover, water bodies and unused land
displayed increasing trends to varying degrees. The ESV of arable land
and grassland continued to decrease from 2015 to 2030; nevertheless,
water bodies exhibited an overall growth trend, but forest cover and
unused land demonstrated significant differences under different

4.2.2. Future scenario prediction
The land use distribution pattern under different scenarios in 2030
was predicted using the SD-MCCA model, RGB images were generated
by mixing various land use structures to display more detailed simula­
tion results (Fig. 7), and the area of various land application categories
under three situations was counted (Fig. 8). The spatial pattern of land
utilization in Xi’an was essentially consistent with various scenes, but
there are distinctions in some parts. Compared with 2015, under the
NIS, the construction land increased by 30.52 %, while the arable land,
forestland and grassland exhibited a declining trend. The spatial distri­
bution of the increase in construction land was basically in accordance
with the decrease in arable land. Under the EDS, the construction land
increased sharply, and the regional economy developed rapidly. The

structures of ecosystem service functions were relatively stable in
different periods. Hydrological and climate regulation were the domi­
nant functions, contributing 49.31 %-51.31 % of general ESV. By com­
parison, primary material and grain yields were the lowest contributors,
accounting for 6.42 % – 7.23 % and having little influence on ESV. The
ESV of hydrologic regulation and waste treatment increased from 2000
to 2015, while the remaining ecosystem services indicated a decreasing

trend. The ESVs of various functions under the NIS and EPS were higher
than those under the EDS. In addition, the ESV of hydrologic regulation
and food production under the NIS was larger than that under the EPS,
but the ESVs of other functions were lower than those under the EPS.
Compared with 2015, the ESV and growth rate of hydrological regula­
tion reached the maximum under the NIS, which were 5491.40×106

which was consistent with the distribution of arable land. The ESVs in
the urban center and surrounding areas were the lowest. Compared with
the ESV in 2000–2015, the losses of ESV under EDS were the largest,
indicating characteristic decreases in high value areas and increases in
low value areas, mainly owing to the pursuit of economic benefits and
urban development. ESV gains were enhanced and losses were reduced
under NIS; nevertheless, the ESV benefits were the highest and the losses
were the lowest under the EPS, which was mainly due to the strict
ecological protection policies in that scenario. The results were essen­
tially in accordance with those of Wuhan (Wang et al., 2018a).

highest and presented an increasing trend under the EPS, while it
decreased under the other scenarios. The ESV of food production
decreased most significantly under the EDS (− 65.62×106 CNY) and the
maximum variation range (-9.66 %).
4.3.2. Spatial characteristics of ESV
The spatial distribution and change details of ESV under the three
scenarios in Xi’an during 2015–2030 are shown in Fig. 10. The distri­
bution pattern of ESV was basically stable in different periods, but there
were differences between regions. Spatial pattern of ESV was highly
consistent with land utilization forms. Medium-high ESVs were mostly
located in woodland and meadowland with good natural conditions,
although low-value areas were chiefly located in northern Zhouzhi, Huyi
and Changan, as well as in most areas of Gaoling, Lintong and Yanliang,

concentrated in the central and surrounding areas, chiefly owing to
rapid urbanization, demonstrating that ESV in these regions had a
negative response to land use change. In contrast, the high SI areas were
different and revealed a scattered distribution, but the SI under NIS and
EPS was relatively high, primarily since the transformation of land use
types with a low value coefficient to ecological land with a high value
coefficient and the land use evolution in these zones had a beneficial
impact on ESV.

districts and counties of Xi’an. On the whole, the ESV was similar in
different periods, but there were great differences in the same period
(Fig. 11). Zhouzhi, Lantian and Changan provided the highest propor­
tion of ESV, which was more than 14.52 %, while the lowest proportion
was found in Lianhu, Xincheng and Beilin, which was less than 0.02 %.
The closer to the downtown area, the lower the ESV of the districts and
counties with higher urbanization levels, and vice versa. From 2000 to
2015, Lintong saw the largest increase in ESV of 5.71 %, while Lianhu
saw the most significant decrease of 79.24 %. From 2015 to 2030, the
ESV of Beilin and Xincheng diminished significantly under the NIS,
mainly due to the lower ESV and the larger variation caused by smaller
numerical changes. In comparison, the reduction in the EDS was more
obvious, mainly because of rapid economic development and intensified
human activities. Nonetheless, in the EPS, the ESV of all districts and
counties tended to be stable and exhibited an overall upward trend,
mainly as a result of the contribution of strict ecological restoration and
protection policies.

4.6. Comparison with simulation results of existing models
MCCA model can effectively forecast future land utilization variation
and has remarkable superiority in land application prediction. In order
to confirm the simulation performance of MCCA model, two land use
prediction models CA-Markov and CLUE-S with widely demonstrated
accuracy were selected. According to the same land utilization data of
Xi’an in 2000 and the driving forces such as geography, climate and
social economy required by MCCA, the results of urban expansion and
alteration in Xi’an in 2015 were simulated. While comparing the overall
simulation results of MCCA, CLUE-S and CA-Markov models, it is
necessary to investigate the details of changes in specific locations.
Fig. 13 exhibits the actual spatial pattern of land use in Xi’an in 2015 and
the distribution condition of land utilization in 2015 simulated by
MCCA, CA-Markov and CLUE-S respectively, and selects three charac­
teristic regions for analysis to comprehensively show the differences of
the models. The results show that the precision of MCCA model is still
significantly higher than that of CA-Markov model and CLUE-S model,
although the space distribution of the actual observation results is
similar to that of the three models. The Kappa index of the MCCA was
0.969, which was better than 0.926 and 0.854 of the CA-Markov and the
CLUE-S. From a macro perspective, the MCCA model has superior
simulation accuracy and has the ability to accurately simulate future
land use spatial pattern variations.
Through the detailed comparison map, it can be found that there are
regional differences in the prediction results of the three models, and the
differences are more obvious for specific land utilization types. The
detail figure c1 indicates that the simulation results of CA-Markov model
show the aggregation characteristics. The prediction of construction
land expansion is relatively conservative, and the simulation of land use

4.5. SI of ESV to land utilization variations
To further reveal the influence of land application dynamics on ESV
in different periods of Xi’an, we calculated and plotted the spatiotem­
poral distribution of SI (Fig. 12). The SI of Xi’an in 2000–2015 was
0.007, implying that the land utilization evolution had an active role in
ESV during this period. In 2015–2030, SI varied greatly under different
scenarios. SI increased slightly under NIS (0.024) but increased signifi­
cantly under EPS (0.508), while it declined significantly under EDS
(-1.744). This suggested that land application transformation had an
active role in ESV under NIS and EPS, while under EDS, ESV had a
negative response to land use spatial differentiation, which was
consistent with the findings of Peng et al. (2021). The physical signifi­
cance of SI revealed that a 1 % change in land use structure in the his­
torical period and NIS would result in approximately 0.007 % and 0.024
% changes in ESV, respectively. However, under EPS, a 1 % increase in
forest cover would give rise to a 2.718 % increase in ESV, while under
EDS, a 1 % decrease in arable land would cause a 1.656 % decrease in
ESV. This result suggested that ESV was sensitive to land use transition.
The spatial distribution of low SI regions in 2000–2015 was similar to
that in the three predicted scenarios, which was predominantly

distribution exhibits a relatively centralized trend. Although the overall
space distribution trend can be kept similar to the actual observation
results, it is difficult to obtain that a large area of land utilization type
contains other independent types, which can be further confirmed in the
c3 diagram. D1, d2 and d3 can clearly display that the CLUE-S model is
more difficult to constrain the disorderly expansion of land utilization
types, and there is a phenomenon that the predicted alterations are not
consistent with the actual situation in some parts, especially the out­
comes presented by d1 and d2. The construction land encroaches on the
cultivated land excessively, resulting in a significant difference between
the simulation outcomes and the actual situation. Compared with CAMarkov and CLUE-S, MCCA shows stable and superior performance in
both spatial simulation and overall accuracy, and the simulation results
have the smallest deviation from the actual. MCCA performs more
detailed and accurate in the simulation of small patches, and is more in
line with the actual land utilization situation. These characteristics not
only simulate the law of urban development, but also reveal the spatial
heterogeneity that the other two models cannot fully reflect. Therefore,
it can be concluded that contrasted to CA-Markov and CLUE-S, MCCA

can more precisely and carefully reflect the urban variation process of
Xi’an and reveal its internal mechanism.
5. Discussion
5.1. A new approach for predicting future ESV
In this research, the novel mixed-cell MCCA model and system dy­
namics SD model were established that considered the actual land uti­
lization and drivers. Equivalent coefficient method was adopted, then
three future land use scenarios were introduced to predict the spatialtemporal heterogeneity response of ESV, to investigate the impact of
land application dynamic transformation on ESV, and provide a new
method for future land utilization simulation and ESV prediction.
Compared with the traditional pure-cell CA model, the land use
competition and transformation rules of the MCCA model were founded
on the mixed information contained in the pixels, which can describe the
dynamic evolution of land use at the subpixel level and help researchers
fully investigate the interaction between multiple driving forces (Liang
13

P. Zhang et al.

Ecological Indicators 147 (2023) 110009

et al., 2021). The prediction results were converted from pure and onedimensional to mixed and multidimensional, making the results more
rational. In terms of simulation accuracy, MCCA has a high reliability
and strong robustness. Since the transformation rules of MCCA empha­
size more competition and conversion on the subpixel scale than con­
ventional models, it can still simulate subtle variations for land use types
with small demand alterations (Zhou and Peng, 2022). The MCCA has
achieved quantitative and continuous simulation of changes in various
land use components in pixels, solved the long-standing difficulties of
the pure-cell model, and obtained more accurate and detailed prediction
results of land use space distribution, realizing the leap from qualitative
to quantitative forecasting. In summary, MCCA can predict the future
pattern of land utilization more realistic. In addition, it also has all the
functions of the pure-cell model because it can alter the mixed structure
into the traditional discrete model (Liang et al., 2021). The combination
of SD model and MCCA model can give full play to the advantages of
quantitative structure optimization and spatial dynamic simulation, and
can deeply reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of land use change
and the ESV response mechanism.

can quantify the variations in economic value corresponding to land use
change and provide references for government decision makers to co­
ordinate ecological construction and economic growth and achieve
sustainable development (Hou et al., 2020). First, determining the
optimal land application configuration is the key to improve ecological
benefits and achieve the goal of maximizing ESV, and urbanization is the
crucial factor affecting ESV changes (Jiang et al., 2020). In the future,
land use management should achieve both economic and environmental
benefits. Rational planning of land utilization allocation by clarifying
the ecological and arable land red lines and urban growth boundary, to
prevent excessive encroachment on ecological land in the development
process (Chen et al., 2021b). Second, the government should promptly
monitor the land use dynamics in areas with significant ESV alterations.
For instance, in the hot spot region of ESV conversions in Zhouzhi, more
ecological land should be developed to strengthen social and economic
benefits, while Beilin, a cold spot zone, should consider slowing the
development trend. Third, the government needs to emphasize plan­
ning, adhere to ecological protection, green and low-carbon principles,
and transform traditional development with its low output, heavy
pollution and recycling difficulties into a green development system
with high efficiency, low emissions and resource regeneration.
Furthermore, due to the significant spatial spillover effect between
urban districts and counties (Bai et al., 2018), regional environmental
protection cooperation needs to be further improved. Additionally,
government decision makers should focus on solving the problems
caused by the degradation of ecosystem service functions, follow the
rules of natural and economic development, convey the concept of
resource conservation and the recycling economy to the public, and
promote public participation in social governance.

5.2. Comparison results with previous studies
This study employs SD-MCCA model to forecast the alteration of ESV
in the future under multiple scenarios in Xi’an, which plays a very sig­
nificant role in the formulation of sustainable development policies and
the exploration of innovative methods of land utilization simulation.
Shao et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2020) explored the dynamic changes of
ESV in Xi’an, the spatial pattern of ESV was basically consistent with this
research, the low ESV regions were mainly concentrated in the urban
center and surrounding zones. In addition, the influence mechanism of
land application scenarios in different areas on ESV was also essentially
similar to that of this study (Kulsoontornrat and Ongsomwang, 2021).
The land utilization prediction model directly determines the pre­
cision of urban spatial layout simulation, and ultimately affects the
response of ESV. Gashaw et al. (2018) applied the CA-Markov model to
forecast land utilization variation and assess the response of ESV in the
Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia (Kappa = 0.83). The researchers used
the CA model optimized by random forest to evaluate the ESV of
Qingdao metropolitan zone (Qin and Fu, 2020) (Kappa = 0.86). The
CLUE-S model has been employed by some scholars to investigate the
spatiotemporal transformations of ESV in Jiangsu Province (Wu et al.,
2020) (Kappa = 0.95). Li et al. (2021) utilized the PLUS model to reveal
the variation mechanism of ESV in the Sichuan-Yunnan ecological bar­
rier (Kappa = 0.87). Ma and Wang (2022) exploited the Markov-FLUS
model to examine the alterations of ESV under the multiple scenarios
of Wuhan Metropolitan Area (Kappa = 0.952). Contrasted with previous
researches, this study adopted the SD-MCCA model to forecast the
response of ESV to land utilization variation (Kappa = 0.969), and the
accuracy was significantly enhanced compared with the traditional
model, and the simulation results were more in line with actual changes.
The SD-MCCA model takes into account the control of land utiliza­
tion quantity and the optimization of spatial distribution, which is a
novel way to probe the dynamic changes of urban development pattern
and ESV. Wang et al. (2022b) and Zhao et al. (2022) optimized land use
simulation according to SD model, and both Kappa reached 0.93,
implying that it is feasible for SD model to improve land application
simulation model. However, most studies are limited to land use pre­
diction, and few are further used for ESV exploration. The coupled SDMCCA model can not only ensure the reasonable quantitative relation­
ship between land utilization types, but also realize the optimization of
spatial distribution. The combined model has stronger performance and
robustness.

5.4. Limitations and future research
The MCCA model was successfully adopted to predict the changes
and heterogeneity of ESV under three future scenarios in Xi’an, but it
still had some limitations. Scenario prediction applies a land use transfer
matrix and government planning policies and does not fully consider the
impact of climate change, social and economic indicators and other
factors (Long et al., 2022). In the future, the MCCA method can be
combined with gray model (Wang et al., 2022b) and integrated with
representative concentration pathways (RCPs), Sustainable Develop­
ment Goals (SDGs), and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and to
quantitatively obtain land application request and model the land uti­
lization pattern in multiple scenarios (Zhang et al., 2022), improve the
simulation accuracy and further explore the response mechanism of
ESV. The value coefficient approach ignores the difference in crop prices
in different periods, which leads to a static estimation of ESV. It also does
not fully consider the complexity of ecosystem types and people’s in­
comes and consumption levels. The accuracy of ESV assessment can be
improved through crop price prediction, value coefficient correction and
ESV spatial optimization (Hu et al., 2019; Ling et al., 2019). The spatial
distribution and variation in ESV are explored by combining the new
MCCA model with the SD model, and the uncertainty generated by
different driving force input data and various urban expansion models
has not been compared, which will be an important research direction
for ESV in the future.
6. Conclusion
We developed an innovative MCCA model and coupled it with the
system dynamics SD model, combined with the equivalent coefficient
method to forecast the future land utilization spatial pattern, and
investigated variations and sensitivity of ESV under different scenarios
from 2000 to 2030. OA (0.9834), mcFoM (0.27) and average RE (0.574)
indicated that the MCCA model had high simulation accuracy and stable
performance. Land application transformation revealed rules of con­
struction land expansion, a slight increase in woodland and cropland

degradation in 2000–2015. The variation trend under the NIS was
consistent with the historical trends, while the acreage of built-up area
was the largest under EDS, whereas increase in forest cover was the most
obvious under the EPS. ESV generally exhibited an increasing trend. ESV
in NIS and EPS enhanced by 3.29×106 CNY and 62.72×106 CNY during
2015–2030, respectively, but decreased by 321.85×106 CNY under EDS.
The benefits of ESV were primarily because of protection and restoration
of ecological land, and decreases were largely result of the acceleration
of urbanization and industrialization. Hydrological and climate regula­
tion accounted for the largest proportion of ESV. The SI under the NIS
and EPS were 0.024 and 0.508, respectively, demonstrating land utili­
zation variation had an active impact on ESV, although SI in EDS was
− 1.744, implying that ESV had a negative response to land use trans­
formation and that ESV was more sensitive to forest cover and arable
land variety. This study employed a novel method SD-MCCA for land use
variations and ESV prediction, which has important theoretical and
practical significance for urban sustainable planning, as well as
ecological compensation policies. In future studies, combination of
MCCA with InVEST and other ecological models will contribute to the
accurate assessment and spatial optimization of ecosystem services.

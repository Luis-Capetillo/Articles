Abstract: As many cities face traffic congestion, pollution, and urban sprawl, transit villages with transit-oriented development (TOD) and
higher ridership have been a core theme for academics and professionals. Evaluating access to metro transit villages with higher transit
demand is critical to assess how TOD and changed transit demand affect neighborhoods. Few studies have measured spatial access to metro
transit villages by combining street configuration and metro ridership to identify its effects on property prices. This study used five newly
developed accessibility and centrality measures to simultaneously capture street configuration and metro ridership within a neighborhood.
The empirical models confirmed the effects of accessibility and centrality to metro transit villages on housing prices considering multiple
walkable neighborhood scales. The models revealed that accessibility and centrality to metro transit villages with higher ridership were
capitalized in higher housing prices within a 2-km network radius. However, prices of houses that were too close to metro stations obtained
weaker premiums due to negative externalities such as crowdedness, congestion, and noise. Residents value housing in walkable neighborhoods with dense, interconnected streets directly routed to metro stations, and transit-oriented communities with higher metro ridership.

Introduction
Public transit has emerged as an alternative to relieve urban transport issues such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and urban
sprawl. Particularly, metro transit has contributed significantly
to providing efficient mobility, reducing congestion and energy
consumption, and minimizing pollution in urban areas (Dai et al.
2016). Thus, academic and professional communities support creating transit villages through transit-oriented development (TOD)
that encourage public transport use and discourage automobile use.
Cervero (1998) called transit-oriented metropolitan areas transit
metropolises. This study identifies neighborhoods surrounding
metro stations as metro transit villages. TOD has evolved from
nodes to places, and transit villages have become the hubs of
transit service and urban development. Whereas the determinants
of transit ridership have been the main interest of urban scholars
and planners, there is limited understanding of how building transit
villages will affect neighborhoods, which are considered the
primary units of urban spatial structure (Wu et al. 2018). This study
determined the value of spatial access to metro transit villages using
housing market prices. The study used spatial accessibility and centrality metrics measuring metro ridership and street configuration
concurrently.
Existing studies highlighted the theoretical and empirical relationship among TOD, metro ridership, and transit villages. TOD
has been the main paradigm combining metro transit and urban
development to create sustainable and livable cities and neighborhoods, because it reduces automobile use (Lewis and Baldassare
2010). Metro ridership represents the core indicator of TOD’s

performance, and also helps in identifying the trends of transit demand and transit-served neighborhoods (Bernick and Cervero
1997). The end goal of TOD is to create transit villages, defined
as built forms and neighborhoods with higher ridership.
Previous studies have proved that metro transit access, TOD
features, and street configuration are capitalized into higher property prices. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of metro
access on property prices, controlling for physical properties, and
environmental attributes (Bowes and Ihlanfeldt 2001). Most studies
conducted empirical analyses of the value-added effects of metro
access on property prices to understand the link between transport
and land-use behavior, provide capitalization evidence for transportation investments, and capture property-market responses
(Cervero and Susantono 1999; Bae et al. 2003; Feng et al. 2011;
Dubé et al. 2013).
Some features of TOD account for variations in housing prices.
Supportive design of a transit station area generates premium housing prices. For example, whereas station areas with park-and-ride
features correlate with discounted housing prices, station areas with
walk-and-ride features are associated with higher housing prices
(Kahn 2007). The emerging relevant literature has focused on the
synergistic effects of TOD on housing prices. A pedestrian-friendly
urban setting combined with TOD generates higher condominium
prices (Duncan 2011). Higher mixed-use land with walkable access
to transit is positively associated with housing prices (AtkinsonPalombo 2010). Furthermore, Hong Kong’s Rail + Property program revealed that transit service combined with well-designed
property development generates a substantial premium in nearby
housing prices (Cervero and Murakami 2009). Conversely, a
Korean study found that ground-level subway stations have a
negative effect on housing prices within 200 m (Lee and Kim
2015).
The TOD features of metro stations tend to attract higher
transit demand and a subsequent increase in housing prices near
stations. According to Sung and Oh (2011), favorable TOD settings
that enhance metro ridership are good transit service networks,
higher land-use mix, pedestrian-friendly street networks, and urban

designs near stations. However, Lee et al. (2013) suggested that
whereas density correlates positively with metro ridership in the
central business district (CBD) and fringe areas, higher diversity
tends to increase ridership in subcentral areas of Seoul. The relationship between density and TOD features such as land-use mix,
design, transit supply, and road features varies with the type of
metro station (Kim et al. 2014).
Street-level microaccessibility and centrality have been the core
factors in explaining and predicting the locations of households and
firms, land-use patterns, property prices, and transportation mobility in mature cities. Many relevant studies have proven that spatial
accessibility to employment centers and retail stores along transportation networks substantially affects housing prices (Osland
and Thorsen 2008). Furthermore, previous empirical studies have
investigated spatial centrality’s association with housing prices. For
instance, concentrated nodes and detours along street networks are
capitalized into higher housing prices because residents value
higher accessibility to save transportation costs (Xiao et al. 2016).
Typical measurements of access to metro stations are straightline and shortest path distance. However, recent studies have
utilized more-advanced concepts of access to metro stations, encouraging more-reliable measurements. For example, route directness indicates the ratio of network distance to straight-line distance
(Lin et al. 2014), whereas opportunity-based transit accessibility
represents the total time-based opportunities, considering number
of employees, network, and service (Lei et al. 2012). Furthermore,
both bus transport availability to metro stations and the distance
to stations influence access to public transit (Kim et al. 2007),
whereas spatial affordance measures the task-relevant characteristics of the place (Fusco 2016).
Housing markets in Seoul have shifted from being supplydriven, indicating large-scale residential development, to being
demand-driven, indicating a preference for convenient public
transit and commuting (Yi and Lee 2014). These trends justify this
empirical study regarding transit villages with higher metro ridership and changing housing prices.
Notably, few studies have examined how spatial access to metro
transit villages with different ridership along street networks affects
housing prices within walkable neighborhoods. We bridged the gap
left by the individual studies of access to metro transit villages identified by metro ridership, street configuration to reach the villages,
and walkable neighborhood housing markets. To provide new findings and insightful implications, this study captured the unexplored
hypotheses linking access to metro transit villages and housing
prices.
First, most studies have focused on the main determinants of
transit ridership, whereas very few have studied how the transit
villages influenced by TOD and changing transit demand affect
neighborhoods along street networks. Clearly, metro transit villages
are not identical in terms of transit ridership and other features
(Debrezion et al. 2011). This study tested whether spatial access
to metro transit villages substantially generates external effects on
the neighborhood housing prices.
Second, many studies measure spatial access to metro stations
and transit villages merely in terms of straight-line or shortest path
distance. Furthermore, many relevant studies fail to identify the
connection between spatial access to metro stations and street
configuration. However, access to transit villages and street layout
synergistically affect neighborhood housing prices (Bartholomew
and Ewing 2011). Thus, this study captured a more sophisticated
measure of spatial access to metro station, combining metro ridership with street configuration to reach the metro stations. Furthermore, many studies have failed to compare the similar and different
effects of access to metro transit villages with spatial accessibility

and centrality under a consistent conceptual structure. A few empirical studies have confirmed the significant effects of street configuration to explain and predict the externalities of metro transit in
housing prices and spatial patterns of land-use intensity, retail
location, and walking volume (Bartholomew and Ewing 2011;
Liu et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2014; Sevtsuk 2014; Kang 2015).
Third, the debate over the spatial scope of externalities from
metro transit villages attracts considerable attention in TOD and
policies. This study traced the spatial trade-off between positive
and negative effects of metro transit villages over walkable neighborhood scales in housing prices. We expected the effects to vary
when it comes to the spatial scope of walkable neighborhoods as
catchment areas for metro transit (Guerra et al. 2012). Various
radius-focused studies found that the neighborhood scale of metro
effects varies widely, from 200 m at the closest to 900 m at the
farthest (Lyu et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2014; Choi et al. 2012; Jun
et al. 2015). Considering metro transit ridership as well as street
configuration generates a more accurate and reliable neighborhood scale of metro transit externalities. This study compared
multiple walkable neighborhood scales to identify the spatial scope
of the externalities and provide inputs regarding urban planning and
design.
Finally, existing hedonic price models in housing studies failed
to properly control the differently aggregated data units such as
individuals and groups. We used multilevel hedonic price models
to capture how explanatory variables at the individual housing and
neighborhood levels affect housing prices (Law 2017).
This study made key assumptions in evaluating the spatial access to metro transit villages by measuring street configuration and
metro ridership of walkable neighborhoods. First, metro transit
villages are defined as neighborhoods with higher metro ridership
(Yang et al. 2016). Second, metro ridership is the core index for
identifying transit villages, because metro transit villages strongly
correlate with higher ridership. Third, the beneficial effects of access to metro transit villages, along with street configurations, are
capitalized in higher housing prices. Therefore, this study measures
access to metro transit villages, street configuration, and metro ridership simultaneously. Finally, a metro station is the centerpiece of
a transit village, as confirmed by the studies of metro catchment
areas (Cervero et al. 2017). The effects of spatial access should
therefore be stronger the closer one is to metro stations. Thus,
we set the walkable neighborhood scale of externalities from metro
stations to up to 2 km and validated the scale with multilevel
hedonic price models.

Data Sources” describes the local context of the housing markets,
public transit in the study areas, and the data sources. Section
“Methods” introduces key variables used in empirical models,

Study Context and Data Sources
Based on this study’s main focus, the author introduces the context
of housing markets and public transit in Seoul, Korea. Seoul had a
resident density of 18,000 people=km2 in 2013 (Jang and Kang
2015), and condominiums are the dominant housing type in the
residential market. Statistics confirm the market share for condominiums at 58.8% and that of single-family housing at 16% in 2010
(Seoul Statistics 2014).

stations. It is highly probable that the street configuration surrounding metro stations and level of metro ridership should generate local
variations in housing prices. More sophisticated metrics utilizing
street configuration and metro ridership for each metro station will
provide more relevant and precise information on residents’ metro
access. Two benefits justify the use of the Urban Network Analysis
(UNA) toolbox developed by Sevtsuk, Mekonnen, and Kalvo of
the City Form Lab (Sevtsuk and Mekonnen 2012). First, previous
methods focused mainly on the straight-line and/or shortest-path
distances to metro stations, failing to capture the spatial configuration to reach metro stations along street networks. UNA calculates spatial accessibility and centrality using morphological
information of the streets. Second, most empirical studies of metro
access ignore the metro demand variation, separating the effects of
street geometry and metro demand. Using the UNA toolbox, the
street-level indexes of spatial accessibility and centrality are
weighted by metro ridership. Hence, the metrics indicate a more
accurate and reliable variation of local metro access. The empirical
tests that value metro access considering housing prices therefore
provide more insightful and detailed policy implications for urban
and transportation planners as well as urban designers. A few recent
empirical models tested the validity of the metrics using the UNA
toolbox in explaining retail location patterns and retail sales
(Sevtsuk 2014; Kang 2016).
Description of Variables

Seoul is a transit-oriented city in terms of volume of transit service, use of public transit, and public transit policy. In 2014, public
transport and passenger cars accounted for 72.8% and 22.8% of all
modes of transportation, respectively. Specifically, bus transit and
subways (including rail) accounted for 27.0% and 39.0% of transportation, respectively. In 2015, the average daily ridership was
7,234,000 for the subway and 4,403,282 for buses, with the average
time taken to access public transit being 8.69 min (Seoul Statistics
2016).
The primary data for the core hypotheses are housing transaction information. Since 2006, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
and Transport has provided sales data on condominiums (called
apartments in Korea). The data incorporate transaction price,
location, floor number, size, year built, and month of sale. This
study geocoded the 2010 data using location information. Additionally, the study geocoded the location of metro stations and
their monthly average on- and off-ridership in 2010 to measure the
metrics of spatial accessibility and centrality weighted by ridership.
On-ridership represents the number of passengers getting onto
metro transit and off-ridership the number of passengers getting
off (Korea Railroad Corporation 2011). Moreover, geographical information on urban core, urban subcore, bus stops, parks, schools,
retail centers, roads, streets, and building use was obtained. Finally,
to measure the neighborhood features, this study utilized the boundaries of the Korean census tract from Statistics Korea (2010). Fig. 1
shows the spatial pattern of monthly average off-ridership in Seoul
in 2010, when metro ridership was mainly concentrated in CBDs.

The empirical models used housing price as a dependent variable
and the following independent variables: (1) five metrics for accessibility of and centrality to metro stations, (2) housing attributes,
(3) location and transportation, (4) neighborhood land use, and
(5) time of housing sales.
Metro Accessibility and Centrality Metrics
The UNA toolbox produces reach and gravity index as accessibility
measures and betweenness, closeness, and straightness as centrality
metrics. Whereas accessibility indexes indicate the ease of reaching
potential destinations, centrality indexes represent the relative importance of the origin along streets (Geurs and van Wee 2004).
Measuring these metrics requires three main types of information—
street geometry from origins (condominium sites) to destinations
(metro stations), destination features (on- or off-ridership), and
network radius. The condominium sites were the centroid of each
parcel with a unique address. Spatial accessibility and centrality
with street configuration, weighted by on- or off-ridership, was
calculated based on mathematical formulas (Fig. 2).
To capture the neighborhood-scale effects and decompose the
local variations of effects, the network radii were set to 500–750,
750–1,000, 1,000–1,500, and 1,500–2,000 m after confirming that
the residents in Seoul walk 2.6 km per day (Park et al. 2016). While
testing the empirical models, the author also used below 500 m and
beyond 2,000 m as radii, but excluded them from the final models
owing to the statistical insignificance of metro access within these
two radii.
This study defines reach and gravity index as the spatial accessibility to metro stations. Reach is the total on- or off-ridership
along the shortest network distance between condominium site
i and metro station j within a given network radius. More metro
ridership within a given network radius generates a higher value
of reach. Therefore, reach, represents neighborhood on- or offridership. The gravity index indicates reach combined with distance
friction. The gravity index is measured by summing the values of
on- or off-ridership (weight) divided by distance friction (Fig. 2).
Higher transit ridership with the same distance friction leads to a
higher gravity index. The beta value of 0.00217 was selected as

of calculating methods, leading to higher premium effects on housing prices. Fig. 2 shows the mathematical formulas for calculating
each accessibility and centrality metric.

Housing Attributes
Our empirical models also controlled for housing attributes such as
size, floor number, and age of housing, which are typical values for
explaining housing price variation. The Korean central government
has provided relevant information since 2006 (Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure, and Transport 2017). Size is measured in square meters for each unit, whereas the floor number represents the vertical
position of each unit in a high-rise apartment building. Age is based
on the year in which the house was built.

centrality. (Data from Sevtsuk and Mekonnen 2012; Kang 2015,
2018a, b.)

distance friction, referring to Handy and Niemeier (2017). This
value was used for two reasons. First, there is no other empirically
tested value for walking behavior to metro stations in Seoul.
Second, the value obtained from the cited study on walking travel
fits into the theme of this study. Empirical tests have verified that
the gravity index correlates with the spatial pattern of land use,
stores, and local employment (Waddell and Ulfarsson 2003).
The centrality metrics include betweenness, straightness, and
closeness. Betweenness measures the volume of detouring a site,
weighted by on- or off-ridership. In this study, the value of betweenness indicates the ratio of total passing at origin i to total available travel between destination j and another condominium site k.
After measuring all passing between and all origin-destination
pairs, betweenness metrics identify the fraction of detours between
the pairs that pass condominium sites i. Betweenness was measured
by summing each fraction multiplied by the on- or off-ridership for
each destination within the given network radius. Therefore, a
site i with increased detouring and higher transit ridership has a
higher betweenness value. Straightness calculates how closely the
shortest-network distance between condominium site i and metro
station j within a specific network radius resembles the Euclidian
distance, weighted by on- or off-ridership (Porta et al. 2006).
Straightness was calculated as follows. After measuring the
shortest-network and straight-line distance of each pair of condominium site i and metro station j within a specific network, the
ratio of the two distances between the straight-line distance and
the shortest-network distance was calculated. Then, the ratio was
multiplied by the on- or off-ridership of metro station j. Finally,
the measured values were added to generate the straightness value.
Therefore, a more direct route between pairs of origins and destinations with higher transit ridership tends to increase the value of
straightness. A higher value of straightness represents direct access
to metro stations with more ridership located along direct routes
from condominium sites. Finally, closeness represents how close
each site is to the surrounding metro stations, weighted by the onor off-ridership within a given network radius. Therefore, the value
of closeness is more likely to increase if metro stations with more
ridership are located close to housing. A lower closeness value
implies more on- or off-ridership for closer metro stations in terms

Location and Transportation Attributes
Housing prices vary with relative location and access to transportation. Prior studies confirmed that distance to CBDs, subCBDs,
roads and streets, public transit access points such as metro stations
and bus stops, commercial centers, schools, parks, and the nearest
land use substantially change residential property prices (Hartell
2017). Therefore, the straight-line distances to these amenities were
measured to control their influence on housing prices.
Neighborhood Land-Use Attributes
The composition of neighborhood land use also affects the value
that residents place on their dwellings. Because the locations of
metro stations consider neighborhood land use, econometric models face endogeneity. Therefore, this study considered neighborhood residential and commercial-office density as typical urban
land use, occupying 90.12% of the total built areas in Seoul.
Whereas residential density was measured as total residential built
area per hectare for each census tract, commercial-office density
was measured by total built area for retail and offices per hectare
of the tract.
A few studies have verified whether the land-use mix and the
balance of land use generate premiums or discounts in housing prices (Koster and Rouwendal 2012). Consequently, land-use mix and
the total floor area by land use type in each neighborhood (Korean
census tract) were measured using mathematical formulas adopted
from related studies (Cervero and Kockelman 1997). This study
applied the entropy index to calculate the neighborhood landuse mix. If the value is closer to 1, it represents evenly mixed land
use as
Pn
P lnðPi Þ
Mixi ¼ i¼1 i
ð1Þ
lnðnÞ
where n = number of land-use categories; and Pi = proportion of
each type of land use i.
This study also calculated the balance indexes of residential and
nonresidential land use from available data (Seoul Metropolitan
Government 2010). The balance index of the two land-use indexes
indicates a higher balance if the value is close to 1 for balance between residential (Resi) and nonresidential (Nonresi) land use in
region i (Cervero and Duncan 2003):


 Resi − Nonresii 

Balance indexi ¼ 1−
ð2Þ
Resi þ Nonresii 
Timing of Housing Sales
The timing of housing sales also influences the housing prices due
to seasonal supply and demand (Quigley 1995). Therefore, dummy
variables were set for the quarter in which houses were sold. In the
empirical models, the reference group of the time variable was the
first quarter of the year 2010.

Empirical Models and Model Specification

individual condominium-level data (Level 1) contain accessibility
and centrality metrics, housing attributes, location and transportation attributes, and time of sales, the Korean census-tract-level
data (Level 2) include residential and commercial-office density,
land-use mix, and the balance index of land use. The equation for
the multilevel regression is as follows:

Aggregate units of data are important in selecting analytic
methods. Prior studies of the effects of individual features and place
attributes tended to face atomistic and ecological fallacies (Duncan
and Jones 2000). Whereas the atomistic fallacy refers to a failure
to capture the local contexts surrounding individual behavior, the
ecological fallacy refers to a failure to infer individual attributes
(Fotheringham et al. 2003). Furthermore, the data composition
of different aggregate units requires econometric models beyond
general regression, due to the deviation of the assumption of
regression analysis (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2008). Alternatively, multilevel regression models could identify the effects of
individual- and place-level factors separately (Fotheringham et al.
2003). Because multilevel regression models use data from discrete
spatial units, the econometric methodology cannot capture the potential spatial autocorrelation of variables in continuous spatial
units (Chasco Yrigoyen and Le Gallo 2012). Despite the potential
spatial autocorrelation issue, multilevel regression models are
widely used, and their effectiveness and robustness for analyzing
spatial data are confirmed (Duncan 2011; Wang et al. 2015; Jang
and Kang 2015). An alternative is to use spatial econometrics and
geographically weighted regression (GWR) if the spatial variables
fit in these models.
Because this study used data on individual condominiums
nested within Korean census tracts, multilevel modeling was applied to the available data. For a variable composition, whereas

After testing the models, a log-log functional formula was
selected in which both dependent and independent variables
were the natural logarithms. The final model results justified
the use of multilevel analysis as an intraclass correlation value

Results and Discussion
Preliminary Analysis
Before the modeling, this study attempted some preliminary analyses. The correlation testing between housing attributes and the
accessibility and centrality metrics indicated no sample selection
bias. Furthermore, to test whether adding accessibility and centrality metrics improved the empirical model fit, the models were compared with and without accessibility and centrality metrics as per
Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). The lower AIC values of the
models with accessibility and centrality metrics indicated that these
models were a better fit than those without the metrics (Antipova
et al. 2011).
After these preliminary analyses, the core hypotheses—that
access to metro stations combining two main factors (street configuration and metro ridership) significantly explains the spatial
variation in housing prices—were tested. To test the hypotheses,
spatial accessibility and centrality with street configuration and

considering on- or off-ridership—on housing prices within each
neighborhood scale. Each model of spatial accessibility and centrality generated similar results among the models. Therefore, the
overall patterns regardless of on-ridership or off-ridership in terms
of network radius were compared. The empirical models confirmed
that greater accessibility and centrality to metro stations generate a
premium in housing prices, excluding the betweenness variable.

Fig. 4. Marginal effects of metro access on housing prices (onridership).

Two accessibility metrics—reach and gravity index—influenced
housing price appreciation. A higher reach value was positively
capitalized in residential property prices. A higher gravity index
value—considering distance friction—was also positively associated with housing prices, except for the 1,500–2,000-m network
radius. This pattern implies that residents value houses with easy
access to metro stations with higher ridership along dense street
networks within walkable neighborhoods, confirming the results
of previous studies (Duncan 2008). This also indicates that homebuyers in Seoul value easier access to metros for commuting, as
well as higher resident and worker density using public transit.
Concerning centrality metrics, higher betweenness discounts
the residential property prices within the 500–1,000 and 1,500–
2,000-m radii. This implies that condominium sites not having
easy access to metro stations are not favorable to housing prices.
Generally, residents prefer a residential location with direct access
to high-ridership metro stations to save on transport costs and enjoy
higher mobility convenience. This result coincides with that of a
study of Chinese cities which found that higher betweenness discounts nearby residential property prices owing to noise and crowdedness from the frequent passing of commuters (Xiao et al. 2016).
Conversely, retail properties favor sites with higher betweenness
within specific street networks (Wang et al. 2014). These contrasting results are rooted in the different features of housing and retail
properties.
Additionally, higher straightness and closeness values generated
premiums on housing prices. The effects of straightness were similar to those of reach within each neighborhood scale. These patterns of effects may indicate that the residents highly prefer housing
near neighborhoods with better street layouts and more directly
reachable high-ridership metro stations. Therefore, urban settings
with high street density, direct access, and proximity to nearby
metro stations with higher transit use command higher premiums
in housing prices. Specifically, because higher straightness indicates trip efficiency for visiting metro stations, being located along
straight-line street networks is positively associated with higher
housing prices. Furthermore, a higher closeness value implies that
highly valued housing is located on street networks with higher
connectivity to metro stations serving transit villages, confirming
the results of the previous studies (Matthews and Turnbull 2007).
Other studies also found that centrality indexes—such as the
straightness and closeness of street networks—are highly relevant
to clustering retail activities and housing prices (Wang et al. 2014).
Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that the effects of accessibility and
centrality—excluding betweenness—on housing prices were higher

with network radii up to 1,500–2,000 m. There are two reasons for
this pattern. First, owing to their large-scale development and relatively low land prices, most condominiums are developed away
from metro stations. Therefore, residents reach the nearest metro
station by bus or on foot. Second, issues such as noise, crowdedness,
traffic, vibrations, and other safety concerns from metro stations and
trips to commercial facilities near the stations discount housing prices, all other variables being equal. Therefore, being too accessible
or adjacent to metro stations influences housing prices negatively.
Fig. 5 shows the spatial pattern of the mean predicted housing price
by each model. These prices were converted from the predicted log
values of housing prices from each model. The five maps—by
models—illustrate that the mean predicted housing price was higher
in the residential areas near the Han River and Kang-nam areas,
where higher-priced housing is mainly concentrated.
The locality and travel behaviors of Seoul residents also supported the key findings of the empirical models. As previously
described, residents and workers in Seoul tend to use metro transit
for their commuting and noncommuting trips, as indicated by its
39.0% modal share. Easy and convenient transfers between metro
and bus transit accelerate the rising premiums related to transit access concerning housing prices. Notably, the average time to reach
public transit is around 9 min, suggesting that many metro stations
and bus stops are located within walking distance from residential
areas. Therefore, street configuration is a critical factor in determining metro access. The core findings are rooted in residents’ travel
behavior, spatial contexts to reach metro stations, and travel patterns across Seoul City. Finally, as previously introduced, higher
metro ridership and pedestrian-friendly and dense streets simultaneously determine the level of accessibility and centrality to metro
stations. Therefore, this study confirms that transit neighborhoods
with higher demand for metro transit also command premiums on
housing prices.
Effects of Other Variables
Other variables also affect housing prices, but with inconsistent
statistical significance. Regarding housing attributes, residents
value larger housing with scenic high-rise views. Older housing has
lower prices within the 750–1,000- and 1,500–2,000-m network
radii. The effects of housing size and floor number were stable
within the same network radii. The results showed that homeowners consistently consider housing attributes as factors of housing
prices. Whereas housing prices are lower when farther from subCBDs, parks, and retail clusters within the 1,000-m network
radius, they are higher with longer distances to bus stops, roads,
and street networks within a 750-m radius. From the empirical results, locational and transportation features significantly explain the
spatial variation of housing prices, which is substantiated by the
results of the previous studies (Xiao et al. 2016). Regarding nearby
land use, whereas being close to residential use discounts housing
price within a 1,500-m radius, access to industrial land use was
negatively associated with housing price within all radii. Higher
access to commercial use generated premiums in housing price
within a 750-m radius. Regarding land-use density, housing prices
in neighborhoods with higher residential density tended to be
lower, except for the 750–1,000- and 1,500–2,000-m network radii,
whereas the prices were higher in the commercial- and office-dense
areas, except for the 1,500–2,000-m network radius. Increased
local competition among residential and nonresidential land use
near metro stations was more likely to raise neighborhood housing
prices. However, land-use mixture and balance between residential
and nonresidential land use erratically affected housing prices
owing to the local contexts. Finally, housing prices decreased over

Conclusion and Policy Implications
This study estimated the value of spatial accessibility and centrality
to metro transit villages—simultaneously capturing street layout
and metro ridership—concerning housing prices. Most previous
studies focused only on the proximity between housing sites and
metro stations (Debrezion et al. 2011). Few studies focused on
how metro transit villages with TOD and change of transit ridership
affect housing prices. Furthermore, there is limited understanding
of the synergistic effects of the two main factors of street configuration and metro ridership on walkable neighborhood housing
prices. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the spatial accessibility
and centrality metrics, including both street geometry and metro
ridership. The empirical analysis revealed that higher accessibility
and centrality, excluding betweenness, commanded premiums on
housing prices within a 2-km walkable network radius. Clearly,
transit-oriented neighborhoods with higher metro ridership, easier
access to metro stations through dense streets, and directly connected street networks have significant positive effects on housing
prices.
Beyond the empirical results of existing studies, our key findings expand the relevant discussion and suggest insightful policy
implications. First, the effects of access to metro transit villages
measured by metro transit ridership on housing prices verified
that residents greatly value housing located in a transit-oriented
community owing to lower commuting times, transportation costs,
and traffic congestion, as well as increased safety from traffic
accidents and better access to destinations. These results imply that
creating metro transit village by TOD is highly acceptable for
housing market and residents. Second, the results of the accessibility and centrality models stated that the synergetic features of both
street configuration and metro transit village substantially explain
the spatial variations in housing prices, implying that housing
markets value a pedestrian-friendly street layout as well as metro
stations with higher ridership. These approaches are helpful in
determining the specific design of transit village–friendly streets.
Thus, urban planning and design authorities should meticulously
create street configurations to connect residential sites and metro
stations. This will ensure metro transit villages with well-organized
streets. Third, the evaluation of spatial accessibility and the centrality metrics presented the specific street morphology that residents
prefer for public transit usage and access. Therefore, urban professionals need to build denser, more interconnected, and more
directly routed streets to reach metro stations with more transit demand. The spatial accessibility and centrality indexes suggest the
effective strategies and systematic design for minimizing negative
effects and maximizing positive externalities of public transit.
Fourth, the empirical tests confirmed that the maximum network
radius for capitalizing metro access in housing prices is 2 km,
which is a walkable distance, although the prices of housing too
close to metro stations obtained weaker premium due to negative
externalities from the stations such as crowdedness, congestion,
and noise. Thus, improving street settings and TOD through measures such as higher density, mixed land use, and street design
should occur within 2 km of metro stations in Seoul to create metro
transit villages. Fifth, this study verified that metro stations being
too accessible, i.e., within 500 m, discounts housing prices owing
to noise, crowdedness, congestion, and other nuisances from the
stations and the surrounding land use. These findings imply that
urban planners and design authorities should allocate commercial
© ASCE

land use instead of residential land use in neighborhoods adjacent
to metro stations that welcome crowdedness and endure noise and
other nuisances from the stations. This tested relationship between
access to metro transit villages and residential developments is
fundamental to resetting land use, transportation systems, and
urban design for more-sustainable cities and neighborhoods. Sixth,
valuing the housing premium from the mixed features of street configuration and metro ridership could be a cornerstone for identifying areas with insufficient affordable housing, predicting residential
gentrification and displacement, and executing value capture of the
windfall of homeowners that gain unexpected benefits from public
investment (Zuk et al. 2018; Kang and Cervero 2009; Cervero and
Murakami 2009). Finally, as shown by the synergetic effects of
access to metro transit villages along street networks on housing
prices, residents value the holistic externalities of public transit
and street layout within walkable neighborhoods. Thus, close collaboration among urban planning and design, land-use planning,
and transportation planning is required for creating transit-oriented
cities and neighborhoods.
Key findings and lessons of this study are transferable to other
cities in the developed and developing worlds. First, the effects of
spatial access to metro transit villages on housing prices vary depending on urban growth and local contexts of street configuration,
urban form, travel behavior, metro ridership, and housing markets.
The available data allow other cities to test how spatial access to
metro transit villages change neighborhood housing markets and
prices. In particular, relevant geographical data are effective for
finding the relation between metro transit villages and housing
prices. Second, other studies can measure spatial accessibility and
centrality to metro stations using our methodology if they have
microlevel street maps and other relevant materials. The newly developed spatial accessibility and centrality indexes will measure
multiple and synergetic features of metro transit villages and street
configuration in simple numbers to be intuitive and understandable.
However, residents’ valuation of the access to metro transit villages
along street networks depends on their preference of metro transit
and travel behavior. Third, although this study recommended
the spatial range of housing premium from metro stations up to
a 2-km network radius, the spatial range in other cities varies with
the locality surrounding metro transit such as urban development,
socioeconomic features, centrality of the stations, travel behavior,
and street layout. Other studies can find the specific neighborhood
scale by applying our analytic methods to the relevant geographical
and quantitative data. Fourth, our multilevel hedonic price models
will be applicable to other cases if they have the suitable data of
individual and neighborhood units in addition to other methodologies such as general regression and spatial econometrics. Finally,
the accessibility and centrality indexes as well as econometric
models of this study are a reference to formulate and evaluate urban
policy and design regarding metro transit villages and neighborhood property markets for other studies. Notably, city leaders are
interested in creating transit villages and monitoring their effects on
neighborhoods. Thus, the methodology and findings from this
study can allow them to understand the deep connection between
metro transit villages and neighborhood property markets, and
support creating urban policy and design for transit-oriented cities.
Furthermore, the approach of this study could be used to identify
the similarities and differences among global cities with different
local contexts. Comparing diverse cases may lead to moregeneralized principles to create transit-oriented and pedestrianfriendly neighborhoods.
This study has several limitations that the author hopes to address in future work. First, it is difficult to predict how access to
planned metro stations along street networks affects the prices of

nearby housing in the long run. If the panel data relevant to this
topic become available, it may be possible to test the spatialtemporal dynamics between public transit access and housing
prices. Second, it is necessary to develop more-sophisticated ways
of measuring metro access. The methodology can be improved and
better variables can be obtained through more-advanced analytics
and data. Lastly, expanding the analysis to compare other contexts
or comparison over time would be valuable in enhancing the
understanding of the effects of metro access.

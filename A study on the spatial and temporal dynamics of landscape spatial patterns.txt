Climate change and urbanization are the main factors causing landscape changes not only in urban areas but also
in rural communities. Rural communities have economic, cultural, social, and significant ecological value. Based
on the background of environmental change, this study selects three main classes of rural communities in Taiwan
as the research areas. Based on the remote sensing images from 2001 to 2020 and the survey of land use status,
the land transfer matrix and landscape index method were used to analyze the landscape spatial pattern changes
and driving forces of rural communities. The results revealed that (1) the land use changes of the four different
types of rural communities have both common features. The growth of construction land and transportation land
area is a common phenomenon, and the growth rate matches the type of rural community. Forest land or
farmland is the main land cover. From the perspective of land transfer analysis, it is the mutual conversion and
loss of agricultural land, forest land and other land. (2) There are differences in the landscape pattern changes of
the three main classes of rural communities. The production community (Dalian) pattern is progressing steadily.
The ecological community (Gangbian) pattern is progressing slowly. The process of living community pattern
varies greatly, while the progress of village experience type (Shuangtan) pattern is slow. The comprehensive
wealth type (Seshui) pattern is developing unevenly and at a fast pace. (3) The driving force of land use change
mainly comes from the policy drive of the public sector, the spatial planning system, and community develop­
ment activities. This study fills in the gaps in the development of landscape spatial patterns of different types of
rural communities, and provides a reference for the formulation of regulations on the spatial planning system of
rural communities in Taiwan.

1. Introduction
Climate change and urbanization are the main factors causing
landscape changes not only in urban areas but also in rural communities.
Climate change is considered to be one of the important driving forces of
land use change and environmental change (Li, et al., 2020; Smith, et al.,
2020; Thapa, 2020). Climate change encompasses global warming, and
natural hazards such as floods, storms, and droughts, which have
adverse effects on food security, terrestrial ecosystems, and land
degradation. Urbanization is one of the most significant environmental
changes of the 21st century (Ning, et al., 2021; Smith, et al., 2020).
Urbanization is increasing worldwide, both in the Asian region and in
the European region. In the context of climate change and urbanization,
the regional structure, industrial system, rural employment, farmers’

lifestyle, and rural environment have all undergone tremendous changes
(Li & Song, 2020; Liu & Li, 2017; Xiao, et al., 2018). Rural environ­
mental change is reflected in changes in land use (Van Eetvelde &
Antrop, 2009; Xie, et al., 2022a), reduction of semi-natural habitats
(Ridding, et al., 2020), and different effects of changes in landscape
function (Gottero & Cassatella, 2017; Häfner et al., 2018; Wu, et al.,
2020). Furthermore, it can lead to a series of environmental problems
such as water degradation, soil pollution, and biodiversity loss (Li &
Song, 2020; Xiao, et al., 2018).
Rural areas have important economic, sociocultural, industrial and
ecological value (Chang, 2021; Ma, et al., 2022; Peng & Wang, 2020; Qi,
et al., 2022). Landscape features are defined as “distinctive, recogniz­
able, and consistent patterns of elements in a landscape that make one
landscape distinct from another” (Allen & Patton, 2013; Medeiros, et al.,

2022). Rural landscape features contain physical landscape components
(landscape type, geology, topography, soil, vegetation, etc), anthropo­
genic elements and components (cultural heritage, land use, field pat­
terns, and human settlements) that make different landscapes distinct
from each other (Van Eetvelde & Antrop, 2009). Furthermore, it is
strongly influenced by elemental or patch composition and configura­
tion (Medeiros, et al., 2022). Understanding rural landscape features
change is critical to formulating more refined sustainable rural land­
scape management (Antrop, 2005; Xiao, et al., 2018).
The analysis of spatial and temporal landscape changes in rural areas
is an important clue to reflect the regional development pattern (Ellis
Erle, et al., 2013), which has always been a hot spot of analysis in the
fields of geography, natural resources, and urban and rural planning
(Xie, et al., 2022b), which can provide important and useful information
for sustainable development to make rational decisions (Tu & Chen,
2020). A comprehensive assessment of changes in rural spatial and
temporal dynamics will benefit the environmental management and
spatial planning of the landscape (Wu, et al., 2020; Xie, et al., 2022b).
The driving factors of spatiotemporal changes in rural landscapes
interact with different factors at different time and space scales to pro­
duce results with different strengths(Abrantes, et al., 2016; Burgi, et al.,
2005; Kristensen, et al., 2016). Among them, different factors include
three major aspects, such as physical environmental factors, socioeconomic factors, legislation and policy (Kristensen, et al., 2016).
Physical environmental factors include topography (slope, land type,
soil, climate, hydrology) and regional location (distance to town, dis­
tance to road, distance to water system) (Li & Song, 2020; Xie, et al.,
2022a; Xu, et al., 2018; Yang & Li, 2020; Kristensen, et al., 2016). Socioeconomic factors include regional industries, population, economic
factors, education levels, literacy levels, and urbanisation levels (Li &
Song, 2020; Xie, et al., 2022a; Xu, et al., 2018; Yang & Li, 2020).
Legislation and policy factors include land ownership, land use regula­
tions, rural development policies, and other activities (Li & Song, 2020;
Xie, et al., 2022a; Xu, et al., 2018; Yang & Li, 2020; Kristensen, et al.,
2016).
The number of studies on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spatial

pattern of different rural communities is limited (no clear typology of
different rural areas), with studies of a single type of rural area domi­
nating. Van der Sluis,et al., (2019a) selected six rural areas in five Eu­
ropean countries as research sites to explore the spatial and temporal
dynamics of different European rural landscape spatial patterns and
changes in landscape services. The findings show that the land use and
cover changes observed in the case studies over the last few decades
have been relatively minor, with urbanization and afforestation pro­
cesses dominating. Kristensen, et al. (2016) investigated patterns of
change in landscape spatial patterns and the driving forces behind them
in rural communities in three different landscape regions (peri-urban
landscapes, areas of agricultural marginal potential, and post-socialist
landscapes) in Europe between 2002 and 2012. The driving force of
rural communities in the urban periphery is related to the nature of fulltime/part-time/amateur farmers. The driving force of rural commu­
nities with marginal agricultural potential is related to aging pop­
ulations, economic decline, and the declining status of agriculture. Postsocialist rural community driving forces are related to agricultural
intensification, the expansion of large-scale farms, and small-scale
farming. Krajewski, et al. (2022) selected rural communities and
urban communities in Poland to investigate changes in landscape spatial
patterns from 2005 to 2020. The findings show that in both commu­
nities, residents are most concerned about residential and commercial/
industrial development on agricultural land. However, the main po­
tential driving force of change is usually the intensification or expansion
of agriculture. Xiao, et al. (2018) investigated the spatial variability of
landscape change in three rural areas (Daxing, Quzhou, and Changshu)
under rapid urbanization in eastern China from 2009 to 2012. The
findings show that the landscape pattern and land use composition of the
three rural areas also varied. Zhang, et al. (2023) studied the evolution
of settlement systems in the alpine pastoral areas of the Tibetan Plateau
and found that since 2005, the settlement system in Nagqu County has
undergone a phase change from concentrated settlement to functional
expansion. Medeiros, et al. (2022) discuss landscape patterns and fea­
tures in the Douro region of northeastern Portugal from 1995 to 2015,
with findings sharing similar trends to other Mediterranean regions,

changes in landscape spatial patterns, including basic survey and pattern
analysis of rural communities. Finally, the analysis of driving force
analysis is carried out to provide suggestions for the land space planning
of non-urban areas.

driven primarily by population decline, agricultural policies, and
wildfires.
Taiwan has been emphasising the development of rural communities
since 1973. Until 2007, a competition for classic farming and fishing
villages was held. At the same time, the Bureau of Soil and Water
Conservation of the Council of Agriculture of the Executive Yuan has a
clear classification of rural communities. By 2022, two editions of the
Taiwan Gold Medal Rural Community Competition have been held and
completed. With the development of the times, rural communities suffer
from several problems such as agricultural decline, arable land aban­
donment, rural migration, and aging (Górka, 2018; Gullino,et al., 2018),
rural landscape features are disappearing (Hanaček & Rodríguez-Laba­
jos, 2018; Peng & Wang, 2020).However, more than 4,000 rural com­
munities in Taiwan also face similar problems: environmental ecology
has not been paid attention to, especially the development of private
land, and the characteristics of rural landscapes are gradually lost
(Chang, 2021; Chang, 2020). In addition, Taiwan’s spatial planning
system is currently in the stage of reform and construction (Lu & Cheng,
2023). 1945 to 1973 was the prototype of the system, mainly following
the “Urban Planning Law” promulgated during the Japanese occupation
era and its implementation rules. From 1974 to 2015, for the reform of
the system, the “Regional Planning Act (RPA)” was promulgated to
control the use of non-urban land, which was separated from the urban
planning law and formed a dual system of urban and rural development.
In 2016, the construction of the system reform began, and in May 2020,
the “Spatial Planning Act (SPA)” was implemented in urban areas.
Today, the SPA in non-urban areas is still under constant revision
(Zhang, et al., 2020). At the same time, through literature review, the
study found that research topics on rural communities in Taiwan were
diverse, but limited in number, such as the landscape evaluation model
(Peng & Wang, 2020), feasibility assessment of green care (Chen, et al.,
2021), etc. There is still a gap in the research and discussion of the
different types of rural communities, and this study can add to this part
of the research contribution.
As mentioned above, rural community development has always been
an important part of the Government’s work. However, the rural com­
munity is facing many problems as it changes and develops over time. As
a result, there have been adjustments and changes to the territorial
spatial plan. Therefore, it is necessary to trace the development of the
landscape pattern of rural communities that already have well-defined
types in terms of spatial and temporal dynamics, in order to fill the
gap in the study of different types of rural communities in Taiwan. This
study investigates (1) the spatial and temporal dynamics of the spatial
pattern of different types of rural community landscapes over the past 15
to 20 years, for the living, productive, and ecological types of rural
communities. In turn, the suitability and compatibility of the developing
situation with the type are verified. (2) The driving force of dynamic
changes in the spatial patterns of living, productive and ecological rural
community landscapes, providing reference materials for reforming and
constructing Taiwan’s non-urban spatial planning system, improving
land use management policies, and promoting sustainable development.

2.2. Selection of research scope
The rural community is mainly divided into three main classes
(production community, living community, and ecological community)
and six subclasses (village experience type, economic production type,
innovative agricultural type, environmental conservation type,
comprehensive wealth type, and original hometown lohas type). The
study area was selected from the 110 key rural communities in Taiwan
as proposed by rural regeneration counties and municipalities and the
Bureau of Soil and Water Conservation of the Council of Agriculture.
Based on the 2007 Top 10 Classic Farming and Fishing Villages and, at
the same time, the intersection of them with the winning areas of Tai­
wan’s Gold Medal Rural Community Competition, it was determined to
filter out rural communities with a good foundation. In combination
with the results of the land use survey, rural communities with a slightly
changed environment were selected. Ultimately, it was ensured that the
rural communities selected included three main classes: production,
living, and ecological communities. Therefore, the production commu­
nity selected the Dalian community (an economic production commu­
nity). The living community selected the Seshui community
(comprehensive wealth type) and the Shuangtan community (village
experience type). Ecological community selected: the Gangbian com­
munity (environmental conservation type).
(1) The living community type includes the Seshui Community of
Dayan Village, Yuchi Township, Nantou County (comprehensive wealth
type), and the Shuangtan Community of Shuangtan Village, Sanyi
Township (village experience type). A living community is defined as a
rural community with a high level of environmental functionality and
standard of living. With the aim of “enhancing the overall appearance,”
the living community focuses on enhancing the maintenance or repair of
historic buildings or facilities of landscape value. The comprehensive
wealth type (life ≥ production ≥ ecology) belongs to the life type. The
proportions of the three life functions are all average, and their sense of
community is relatively complete. In terms of the development
sequence, it still follows the sequence of life, production, and ecology of
humanistic thinking. The village experience type (living ≥ ecology >
production) belongs to the living type. Although the production function
is still dominated by primary and secondary industries, it is not the main
source of economic income for rural residents. The reason for the higher
proportion of living standards lies in the functionality of the rural
community’s environmental facilities and in the fact that the standard of
living has reached a certain level. Under this background, the preser­
vation of the natural environment and culture of the rural community
has become an important direction.
Seshui community (Fig. 2 A) is located along road number 21 of
Taiwan, surrounded by mountains, the ground looks like a lotus valley,
and the altitude is about 600 to 800 m. The early years of the Seshui
community were dominated by rice cultivation and betel nuts. The 1940
s saw the rise of Assam’s tea, which became a major industry as the
population switched to black tea cultivation. After liberation, Taiwan
Tea No. 18 Red Jade became the representative of its agricultural
products. After the 921 earthquake, black tea and other foodstuffs
continued to be its specialty. The community also has natural white fairy
soil, which is an excellent material for pottery, and pottery is the com­
munity’s trademark. Bamboo is also a local specialty, preserved in
everything from traditional architecture and everyday objects to the art
of bamboo weaving. However, following the 921 earthquake, the
neighborhood was severely devastated and replaced with new structures
that were known as the “Little Switzerland of Taiwan” because of their
white exteriors, blue roof tiles, and pitched roofs.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Research structure and design
The overall idea of this research is divided into the following four
parts (Fig. 1). First, confirm the selected rural communities and their
categories, mainly covering three main classes (production, living,
ecological community), and specifically four subclasses (economic
production type, comprehensive wealth type, village experience type,
environmental conservation type). Secondly, the selected research
methods include the confirmation of land use data, the classification of
land use category (farmland, forest land, transportation land, water use
land, construction land, other land), the selection of landscape index
(related to landscape preferences), and the use of land use transition

The Gangbian community (Fig. 2 D) is located at the southernmost end
of the Lanyang Plain, bordering the northernmost end of the Central
Mountains, and is a community with a coastline. The ecological com­
munity is defined as one in which improvements in hardware and
equipment include the upgrading of living environment facilities and
conditions. The environmental conservation type (ecology > produc­
tion ≥ living) belongs to the ecological type. This kind of community is
oriented by its environmental and ecological characteristics, and
ecological and production functions are the main and secondary items.
However, the proportion of ecological functions is far greater than the
importance of production functions and life functions. Its community
has a small number of primary and secondary industries, and its eco­
nomic income comes from tertiary industries, including homestay ex­
periences and ecological education and interpretation.
The community originally consisted of several settlements around
the wetland, was rich in offshore fishing resources, and was a traditional
community living on tractors and farmland. The 1970 s saw the devel­
opment of cultural and economic activities featuring the traditional
maritime culture of tug-of-war, such as tug-of-war dance dramas and
tug-of-war competitions, which added to the vibrancy of the commu­
nity. Later, due to social changes and wastewater pollution, the fisheries
resources dwindled, and the community’s population was faced with
changing jobs, emigration, and aging. In 2001, the “eco-community”
development axis has been introduced to develop sustainable commu­
nities. The community is one of the important wetlands recognized by
the International Wetland Conservation Alliance. It covers an area of
102 ha and is a dry port bird sanctuary, where more than 170 species of
birds inhabit. In recent years, the community has successively proposed
rural regeneration plans such as the “Green and Resilient Endless Port”.

Shuangtan community (Fig. 2 B) is located in the hilly area of
Guandao Mountain, 700 m above sea level, with county road 130
running through it. The residents are mainly Hakka people. The com­
munity’s tranquil natural landscape and traditional woodcarvings have
attracted many artists. Most of the residents are still involved in
woodcarving, followed by farming. It also features an old charcoal road
from the early days, authentic Hakka food culture, wood carving and
painting, face painting, Hakka cultural painting, and other DIY activ­
ities. The Community Village Regeneration Project aims to “create a
happy Shuangtan through the creation of an agricultural art and wood
art village”, to create a happy village and craft village with the rebirth of
old settlements, the revitalization of old and new industries, the pro­
motion of the forest industry, and the sustainable development of the
ecology, thereby improving people’s lives.
(2) The productive community selected in this study is the Dalian
community (economic production type) in Tianwei Township, Chan­
ghua County. Dalian community (Fig. 2 C) is located in the western
plains along the side of Provincial Highway 1. A production community
is defined as a community whose main direction of development is the
enhancement, maintenance, and improvement of the living conditions
of the production environment. Therefore, basic agricultural production
and monitoring of public facilities are established at all stages of pro­
duction and marketing. The production community is actively building
up a professional production and sales area with integrated production
and sales and is focusing on the establishment of diversified marketing
channels. The economic production type (production > life > ecology)
belongs to the production type. It utilizes the land management form
and takes agricultural production as the community’s livelihood, and
the production and living functions are the main development charac­
teristics. Among them, the development of the primary and secondary
industries is greater than the function of life. In addition, due to its
location, environment, and development characteristics, its ecological
nature is not the main focus.
The community is named after the sickle made by the ancestors to
reclaim wasteland. Its flower cultivation history can be traced back to
the Qing Dynasty. During the Japanese occupation period, its industry
was already impressive, which laid the foundation for the development
of the community’s flower industry. The community offers a wide range
of activities and features, such as bike rides, night tours of the chry­
santhemum, and flower auction centers.
(3) The ecological community type selected the Gangbian commu­
nity (environmental conservation type) in Suao Town, Yilan County.

2.3. Data collection
The data for this study were obtained from orthophotos published by
the Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Aerial Surveying, Council of
Agriculture, Executive Yuan, with an image resolution of 5 M. The image
standard for image selection is that the aerial photo has the lowest cloud
cover (0 %), and the community boundary range is the simplified
version of the rural regeneration range released in 2018. The collected
remote sensing image data from 2001 to 2021, the 20 years are divided
into three six-year periods (2001, 2007, 2013, 2019/2020) for discus­
sion. To ensure the validity of the drawings obtained, the study was also
accompanied by a field survey to document the land conditions and
check the changes in the land. In addition, two researchers used ArcGis
to decode and analyze the remotely sensed images, and the decoded
maps were proofread using the digitized maps from the Bureau of Soil
and Water Conservation, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, as a
reference to ensure their accuracy. After comparing the community
boundaries of different periods, it is found that the community bound­
aries of Seshui, Gangbian, and Dalian communities have not changed.
Only the rural regeneration boundary of Shuangtan community is
slightly smaller than the original community boundary, and the com­
munity boundary range has no effect on the study. However, due to the
limitation of its image data, there will be some deviations in the image
data. For example, the map data of the third phase of Seshui Community
can only be selected in 2011, because the map data in 2012 and 2013 is
cloudy. In addition, there is no 2001 map for Dalian community for
research use, so the research period for this community is from 2007 to
2020.
2.4. Extraction of land use type information
The classification of land use is based on the accuracy of the map, the
environmental characteristics of the study area, and the needs and ob­
jectives of the study. Xiao, et al. (2018) classify rural land into three
main categories, namely farmland, semi-nature land, and construction
land. Van der Sluis,et al., (2019a) classify land in the Roskilde into seven
5

categories: settlement, lake, forest, grassland, wetland, cropland, and
sea. Wang and Wen (2021) classify traditional villages in forest areas
into six categories: forestland, grassland, arable land, waterbody, arti­
ficial pavement, and wetland. Liu, et al. (2014) classify village-scale
rural land in Yucheng into seven categories: farmland, woodland,
rural settlements, rural facilities land, transportation, waterbody, and
unused land.
This study is based on the survey method of the current state of land
use (Construction Department of the Ministry of the Interior of the Re­
public of China, 2019). Considering the accuracy of the drawings and
the environmental survey of land use forms through rural communities
in Taiwan, land use was classified into six categories: farmland, forest
land, transportation land, water use land, construction land, and other

land (Table 1). The six land use categories were considered sufficient for
this study.
2.5. Land use transition matrix
To gain a better understanding of the inter-transformation relation­
ships between various land-use landscape types, a transition matrix was
chosen to reflect the specific situation of the landscape type structure in
the study area and the mutual transfer of various landscape types.
Therefore, the transition matrix can analyze the source, destination and
type composition of landscape type transition (Xu, et al., 2017).

index, core area, proximity, diversity index, and sprawl index). Selecting
more comprehensive indicators is of great significance for analyzing the
spatial and temporal dynamic changes of rural communities. Second, it
is necessary to select a consensus landscape index related to landscape
preference (Appendix A. 1). Because follow-up research of this study
needs to be combined with landscape preference. Next, to ensure the
comprehensiveness of the landscape index, Core_MN and SHEI are
added. Finally, selected landscape indices include AREA, PLAND, NP,
PD, TE, ED, FRAC_AM, SHAPE_AM, Core_MN, ENN_MN, SHDI, SHEI,
SIDI, SIEI, and CONTAG. After the selection of indicators is completed,
the landscape indicators required for this study are classified, and their
scales and meanings are explained, see Appendix A. 2.

2.6. Selection of landscape index
There is a correlation between landscape index and landscape pref­
erence. The land cover structure of the landscape is the basic element,
and the landscape index is the digitization of its structure and has an
impact on landscape perception and perception (Giles & Trani, 1999).
Crawford (1994) and Palmer (1997) proposed that spatial indicators
commonly used in landscape ecology can be used as indicators of
landscape preference. Smardon, et al. (1986) and Franco, et al. (2003)
pointed out that there is a significant correlation between landscape
diversity index and landscape preference. Palmer (2004) found that the
landscape index can explain most of the changes in landscape preference
and perception, and ED has a significant positive correlation with
landscape value. Gonzalo, et al. (2006) explored the Mediterranean
climate landscape and found that the SIEI was positively correlated with
the beauty of the landscape within a 1 km2 viewing area. In the 0.25
km2 viewing area, NP, SIDI, and SIEI were negatively correlated with
legibility. Patch shape was correlated with double pairs of DFLD, CONT,
and SIEI, and landscapes with irregular shapes had higher visual
complexity. Dramstad, et al. (2006) found that SHDI, PR, NP, TE, and
AREA are positively correlated with landscape preference. Fry, et al.
(2009) pointed out that the coherence, complexity, scale, naturalness,
and ecological index in landscape preference have commonality. For
example, coherence is correlated with PR and PLAND; complexity is
correlated with SIEI, dominance index, shape richness index, AREA,
heterogeneity index, ED, and sprawl index; visual scale is correlated
with PLAND, AREA, and ENN_MN; and naturalness is correlated with
PLAND and FRAC. Schirpke, et al. (2013) studied mountain landscapes
and found that shape complexity (SHAPE_MN, SHAPE_MD, FRAC_MN,
FRAC_MD) and landscape diversity (SHDI, SHEI, SIDI, MSIDI, SIEI,
MSIEI) are positively correlated with scenic beauty, CONTAG is nega­
tively correlated with scenic beauty. Schirpke, et al. (2021) studied the
impact of past landscape changes on the aesthetic landscape value of the
European Alps, they found that MSIEI had a significant negative impact
on aesthetic value; AREA_AM and SHAPE_CV had a significant positive
impact on aesthetic value.
The selection of landscape indicators, first of all, needs to ensure the
comprehensiveness of the landscape index, which needs to cover eight

2.7. Graphic processing
The research takes one year as the base period, and the figure for
each period is obtained through the following procedures. The land use
map is an image processed from satellite imagery using ArcGIS 10.5
software. Using manual visual interpretation, valuation information for
land use maps is created through a series of operations such as map
tessellation, cropping, layer creation, linear editing, surface trans­
formation, raster conversion, and map production. However, for the
accuracy of drawing processing, this manuscript was processed with
ArcGIS. Starting with the earliest year, stack drawings of different years,
carefully check each area and change the category boundaries and
classifications of changes. For example, if the land category in a certain
area has not changed, the boundary line of the category will not change
due to the change of the year, thus reducing the error. If each year were
to be recreated, its accuracy would be uncertain and differences would
accumulate.

to 2019 can be seen. The total area of the community is 110.18 ha.
Looking at the land cover in each year (Table 2), the areas of con­
struction land, transportation land, other land and water use land have
increased by 1.97 %, 1.33 %, 11.54 %, and 0.04 % respectively. The loss
of forest and farmland is more serious. Forest land is the primary land
cover type, farmland is secondary, and followed by the category of other
land.
From Table 3, we can see the mutual conversion of each year and
each category of land. The changed area of construction land was 3.18
ha, and the area of farmland and other land transferred to it was the
most,1.26 and 1.17 ha. The area of changed transportation land was
3.21 ha, and the area of forest land and farmland transferred to it was
the most, 1.36 and 1.13 ha. The changed area of farmland was 12.89 ha,
and the area of forest land and other land transferred to it was the most,
10.91 and 1.29 ha. The changed area of other land was 18.50 ha, and the
area of farmland and forest land transferred to it was the most, 10.17
and 7.18 ha. The changed area of forest land was 8.89 ha, and the area of
farmland and other land transferred to it was 5.29 and 2.61 ha. The
changed area of water use land was 0.05 ha, and other land and farm­
land transferred to construction land was 0.30 and 0.12 ha. It can be
seen that the transfer of various types of land in the community is the
mutual transformation of farmland, forest land, and other land.

3.1.3. Productive Dalian community
Through Fig. 5, we can see the land use change of Dalian community
from 2007 to 2020. The total area of the community is 143.95 ha, see
Table 6 for the land cover of each year. The area of construction land,
transportation land, and farmland have increased, while other land,
forest land, and water use land have decreased. The land cover of the
community has changed in three periods, and the top three categories
are farmland, forest land, and other land in 2007; farmland, other land,
and forest land in 2013; farmland, forest land, and other land in 2020.
From Table 7, we can see the mutual transformation of different
periods and different types of land. The changed area of construction
land was 6.97 ha, and the areas transferred to it from farmland and other
land were the largest, 2.68 and 2.58 ha respectively. The changed area of
transportation land was 7.73 ha, and the area of other land and farmland
transferred to it was the largest, 2.82 and 2.52 ha respectively. The
changed area of farmland was 25.92 ha, and the area of forest land and
other land transferred to it was the largest, 12.51 and 9.30 ha respec­
tively. The changed area of other land use was 12.66 ha, and the area of
farmland and forest land transferred to it was the largest, 6.35 ha and
4.00 ha respectively. The changed area of water use land was 0.13 ha,
and the areas of farmland and forest land transfer were 0.07 and 0.05 ha
respectively.

3.1.2. Living community- Shuangtan community
Fig. 4 shows the land use change of Shuangtan community from 2001
to 2019. The total area of the community is 1329.64 ha. Overall
observation of land cover in each year (Table 4), forest land is the main
land cover type accounting for about 80 %, and other land use is the
second. As of 2019, transportation land replaced farmland as the third
land cover type. Compared with 2001, the area of construction land,
transportation land, forest land, and water use land increased by 0.85 %,
0.88 %, 1.09 %, and 0.03 % respectively. The area of farmland and other
land use decreased by 0.24 % and 2.62 % respectively.
From Table 5, we can see the mutual transformation of each stage
and each type of land. Compared with 2001, the area of construction
land changed by 15.10 ha. Other land and forest land transferred to
construction land were the largest, 8.12 and 4.7 ha respectively. The
changed area of transportation land was 15.51 ha, and the area of forest
land and other land transferred to it was the largest, 7.47 and 5.12 ha
respectively. The area of forest land change was 74.54 ha, and the area
of other land and farmland transferred to forest land were the largest,
64.89 and 5.51 ha respectively. The changed area of water use land was
2.36 ha, and the area of other land and forest land transferred to water
use land were the largest, 1.31 and 0.83 ha respectively. The changed
area of farmland was 15.45 ha, and other land and forest land were
converted into farmland the most, 8.24 and 6.82 ha respectively. The
area of other land changes was 52.86 ha, and forest land and farmland
were converted into other land-uses the most, respectively 40.20 and
10.38 ha. It can be seen that the transfer of various types of land in the
community is the mutual transformation of farmland, forest land, and
other land.

3.1.4. Ecological Gangbian community
Through Fig. 6, we can see the land use change of Gangbian com­
munity from 2001 to 2018. The total area of the community is 299.37
ha. Judging from the land cover of each stage Table 8, the area of
construction land, water use land, transportation land and other land
has increased, while the area of forest land and farmland has decreased.
Forest land was its main land cover type. Before 2013, farmland was the
secondary land cover type. After 2013, other land became the secondary
land cover, and farmland was the third type of land cover.
From Table 9, we can see the mutual conversion of different stages
and different types of land. The changed area of construction land was
5.06 ha, and other land and forest land were transferred to it the most,
2.13 and 1.36 ha respectively. The changed area of transportation land
was 3.96 ha, and other land and forest land were transferred to it the
most, 1.47 and 1.44 ha respectively. The changed area of farmland was
11.89 ha, and forest land and other land were transferred to it the most,
6.80 and 4.25 ha respectively. The changed area of other land was 30.29
ha, and the forest land and farmland were transferred to it the most,
13.03 and 12.64 ha respectively. The changed area of forest land was
10.90 ha, and other land was transferred to it the most, which was 6.92
ha. The changed area of water use land was 3.60 ha, and other land was
transferred to it the most, which was 2.57 ha. It can be seen that the
transfer of various types of land in the Gangbian community is the
mutual conversion and loss of farmland, forest land and other land.
3.1.5. Land use in different types of rural communities
Table 10 can be used for comprehensive analysis. From 2001 to
2020, the land use changes of four different types of rural communities
have something in common. Ecological land includes forest land,

grassland, water use land, and unused land. The proportion of ecological
land in ecological rural towns is the largest, followed by farmland.
Agricultural production-oriented rural towns have a large proportion of
ecological land and farmland. In this study, according to the classifica­
tion standards of rural communities in 2011, living communities are
suitable for the development of construction land and roads, productive
communities are suitable for the development of farmland, and
ecological communities are suitable for the development of forest land,

other land and water use land. (1) From the perspective of land use
analysis, the growth of construction land and transportation land area in
the four communities is a common phenomenon. The order of growth
rate of construction land from high to low is Seshui community (living
community) > Dalian community (productive community) > Shuangtan
community (living community) > Gangbian community (ecological
community). The order of growth rate of transportation land area from
high to low is Dalian Community (productive community) > Seshui
10

F. Ning et al.

Ecological Indicators 157 (2023) 111227

Community (living community) > Shuangtan Community (living com­
munity) > Gangbian Community (ecological community). Therefore, it
can be found that the growth rate of construction and transportation
land matches the type of rural community. From the perspective of land
cover types, forest land or farmland in each community is the most
important land cover, but each community has its own characteristics. In
Seshui community and Gangbian community, forest land, farmland and
other land are the top three main land covers. Farmland, forest land, and
construction land in Dalian community are the first three main land
covers. Forest land, other land, and transportation land in Shuangtan
community are the first three main land covers. From the perspective of
land transfer analysis, it is the mutual conversion and loss of farmland,
forest land, and other land.

more complicated, still approximately square, and there may be manual
intervention. The reduction of CORE_MN indicates that the core patch
area is reduced. The decrease of the proximity index indicates that the
distance between patches gradually decreases. CONTAG is reduced to
58.96 with moderate sprawl, implying reduced patch continuity and
fragmented landscape with small and scattered patches. SHDI and SHEI,
SIDI and SIEI have all increased year by year, respectively, from 1.2 and
0.67 to 1.38 and 0.77, 0.61 and 0.73 to 0.70 and 0.84, indicating that the

10.31 %. NP and PD reached their peak in 2013 and then declined, while
TE and ED showed a first increase, then a decrease, and then an increase,
and reached their peak in 2019, indicating that the overall landscape of
the community is fragmented. FRAC_AM has not changed overall, and is
relatively stable at 1.23, indicating that the shape of the plaque tends to
become more complicated, but it does not deviate too much from the
square. CORE_MN showed a decreasing trend as a whole, and decreased

The larger the value, the
more patches of land. This
metric provides an
understanding of the
landscape composition and
the area of each patch.
The percentage of the patch
to the landscape area shows
the proportion of each type
of land use.
The total number of patches
in the landscape, NP ≥ 1, no
upper limit.
The number of patches per
square kilometer, PD > 0,
no upper limit. The higher
the value, the more serious
the fragmentation of the
landscape pattern.
The total length of all patch
edges in the landscape, TE
≥ 0, no upper limit.
ED ≥ 0, no upper limit. The
index measures the total
edge length of each type of
patch. When the edge
density is higher, it means
that the proportion of edge
length in the landscape is
also longer. This is used to
understand the complexity
of shapes. The greater the
change of ED, the higher
the degree of
fragmentation.
1 ≤ FRAC_AM ≤ 2. For a
patch in two dimensions, a
value greater than 1
indicates a deviation from a
square or rectangle. The
value tends to be close to 2,
which means that the patch
shape is complex.
SHAPE_AM ≥ 1, no upper
limit. Its value increases
with the irregularity of the
patch shape; SHAPE_AM =
1 when all patches in the
landscape are square.
Core_MN ≥ 0, the larger the
value, the more the core
area.
The neighboring distance is
the sum of the neighboring
distances of similar patches,
and the neighboring
distance is the edge-to-edge
distance. The larger the
index, the more distant the
patches are from each other
and the higher the
dispersion. The smaller the
value, the closer the
patches are.
SHDI ≥ 0, no upper limit.
When there is only one
patch type in the landscape,
SHDI = 0. The value of
SHDI increases when the
patch type increases or the
proportion of area occupied
by each type of patch tends
to be close to each other.

The development speed of landscape spatial patterns in Seshui com­
munity is faster than that of Gangbian community. Among the six land
use situations in the two communities, the loss of forest land and
farmland area is the most severe. The overall landscape shows a trend of
continuous fragmentation, the shape of the patch tends to be more
complex, the core area is reduced, the distance between the patches is
reduced, the degree of aggregation is reduced, and there are small and
scattered patches. However, the overall diversity and uniformity of its
landscape continue to increase. The Seshui community is a compre­
hensive wealth type/living rural community, according to the ratio of
three living things, life ≥ production ≥ ecology, the development of
landscape space pattern in this community is unbalanced. The Gangbian
community is an environmental conservation type/ecological rural
community, according to the ratio of three living things, ecology >
production ≥ life. Judging from the current situation, the progress of the
landscape spatial pattern of the community is slow, and the fragmen­
tation of forest land, other land and water use land are deepened, and
the shape is complex, basically moving forward in accordance with the
direction of ecological development.
The Shuangtan community is a village experience type/living com­
munity, according to the ratio of three living things, living ≥ ecology >
production. Judging from the current situation, the progress of the
landscape spatial pattern of this community is slow, and it develops
according to the category of rural communities, and its general trend is
deepening of fragmentation. The community patches are unevenly
distributed, dominated by dominant species, with limited ecological
functions, and limited development in both diversity and uniformity.
The Dalian community is an economic production/production
community, according to the ratio of three living things, production ≥
living > ecology. Judging from the current situation, the landscape
spatial pattern of the community is stable and develops according to the
category of rural communities, and the community as a whole shows a
development trend of reducing the degree of fragmentation. The edge
complexity of the patch is reduced, the shape of the patch is complex, the
distance between the patches becomes farther, and some patches are
more aggregated and continuous. Although the diversity and uniformity
of the landscape have decreased, it is generally stable.

shows that the degree of fragmentation of the community landscape is
gradually reduced, there is a phenomenon of patch merging, and the
complexity of the edge is reduced. Both SHAPE_AM and FRAC_AM show
an increasing trend year by year, indicating that the shape of the patch
has become more complex. CORE_MN is unchanged. Both ENN_MN and
CONTAG showed a state of falling first and then rising. ENN_MN rose
from 11.93 to 14.03, and CONTAG rose from 54.22 to 54.77. It means
that the distance between patches becomes longer, and some patches are
more continuous. SHDI, SHEI, SIDI, and SIEI did not change signifi­
cantly, but decreased slightly. Although the landscape diversity and
uniformity decreased, they were generally stable.

4. Discussion
4.1. Land use change in rural communities
The results of the study show that the growth rate of construction and
transportation land in rural communities matches the type of rural
communities. Guo, et al. (2022) also found similar findings in rural areas
of the Himalayas. Although construction land expansion is a common
trend in urbanization (Ridding, et al., 2020; Van der Sluis,et al., 2019a;
Vimal, et al., 2012), Xiao, et al. (2018) and Guo, et al. (2022) found that
the growth rate of construction land in rural areas is slow, which is
consistent with the results of this study. From the perspective of land
cover types, forest land or farmland in each community is the most
important land cover (Wang & Wen, 2021), but each community has its
characteristics. From the perspective of land transfer analysis, land use
in rural communities is the mutual conversion of farmland, forest land
and other land uses. The research of Wang, et al. (2022) also has similar
results. Global agricultural land reduction is a general trend (Alphan,
2003; Van der Sluis,et al., 2019a; Wang & Wen, 2021), and changes in
agricultural land will affect rural ecosystem services, thereby affecting
human well-being (Peng & Wang, 2020). The research by Xiao, et al.
(2018) found that the trend of farmland loss in the three rural areas is
the same, but at different speeds, which is similar to the results of the
living and ecological rural communities in this study. Van der Sluis,
et al., (2019a) found that the conversion of farmland to forest or set­
tlements was common, a result consistent with the results of the four
rural communities included in this study.

3.2.4. Ecological community -gangbian community
Table 14 shows the overall changes of the Gangbian community in
the four periods. From 2001 to 2018, the patch density and edge index
showed an upward trend, increasing by nearly 50.42 % and 26.32 %,
respectively. It shows that the overall landscape of the community is
fragmented, and the number of patches and edge density increase. The
overall trend of SHAPE_AM and FRAC_AM is still increasing, indicating
that the shape of the patch tends to become more complicated, and the
boundary of the patch becomes slightly more complicated and tends to
be square. CORE_MN, ENN_MN and CONTAG showed a decreasing trend
as a whole, decreasing by 40 %, 12.73 %, and 3.31 % respectively. It
shows that the patches are divided into small and scattered patches, the
core area is reduced, and the distance between patches is closer. SHDI,
SHEI, SIDI, and SIEI have the same trend, and they all increase overall,
indicating that the diversity and uniformity of the overall environment
of the community are developing towards a benign development.
3.2.5. Different types of rural community landscape index
Although the Seshui community and the Gangbian community
belong to different types of rural communities, they have a high degree
of similarity in terms of land use and landscape level index development.

4.2. Changes and driving forces of landscape spatial pattern in rural
communities

communities to rationally utilize land in rural communities and improve
the community environment (Chen, 2004). In 2007, the Council of
Agriculture of the Executive Yuan held a selection activity for classic
farming and fishing villages. A total of 10 farming and fishing village
communities were selected, and five awards were awarded and subsi­
dized. Therefore, before 2007, life-type, ecological-type, and
production-type rural communities should respond to agricultural
development regulations and amendments, methods for building farm­
houses on agricultural land, selection of classic farming and fishing
villages, guiding policies for creating a new rural look, and selfdevelopment, etc. Hardware development is the main focus, and land
conversion is relatively large. The landscape spatial pattern at this stage
is in a stage of development that tends to be fragmented.
Until 2008, the land development was carried out in accordance with
the “Regulations and Implementation Rules on Land Rezoning in Rural
Communities” to handle the four-year demonstration plan for land
redesignation in rural communities and the six-year demonstration plan
for land redesignation in rural communities. In 2009, the “Rural Com­
munity Land Redesignation” was launched, with the purpose of
improving the living environment in rural areas, constructing a new
style of rural areas, and improving the development of rural commu­
nities. In addition, in 2009, the Bureau of Soil and Water Conservation of
the Council of Agriculture of the Executive Yuan formulated the “Plan
for Revitalizing the Economy and Expanding Public Construction In­
vestment”. The main work items of the plan include the preliminary
planning of rural regeneration construction, participatory greening and
beautification of rural living environment, and accelerating the
improvement of rural basic environment. From 2009 to 2012, the Bu­
reau of Soil and Water Conservation of the Council of Agriculture of the
Executive Yuan formulated “Building a Rich New Countryside”, focusing
on the existing rural communities, strengthening the bottom-up joint
participation system, and emphasizing the commonality of rural in­
dustries, natural ecology and living environment planning and con­
struction. In 2010, the Council of Agriculture of the Executive Yuan
began to formulate the “Rural Community Regeneration Plan 1.0″. Based
on the principle of three life (life, production, and ecology), in addition
to improving the hardware environment, it gradually favored software
construction (encouraging young people to return to their hometowns
for employment). etc. Moreover, the rural regeneration plan is divided
into three phases: 2012–2015 is the first phase of rural regeneration;
2016–2019 is the second phase of rural regeneration; 2020–2023 is the
third phase of rural regeneration. The first phase of rural regeneration
from 2012 to 2015 has been completed. The completed content includes
that the community construction began to focus on software and sup­
plemented by hardware. The community promotes the improvement of
dirty spaces, and strengthens the community to improve dirty, messy,
broken and other spaces. In addition, looking at the development of
Taiwan’s spatial planning system, from 1974 to 2015, the ”Regional
Planning Act (RPA)“ was implemented. The urban planning part of this
code has statutory planning, and non-urban planning is regulated by
land control rules (Lu & Cheng, 2023; Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore,
living, ecological and productive rural communities have undergone
land transformation in 2013 in response to such policies as land
rezoning, building a rich new countryside, spatial planning system and
rural regeneration plan, and are in the transition from hardware to
software development. At this stage, the landscape spatial pattern is still
in a stage of fragmented development. The landscape fragmentation
phenomenon is most obvious in the Gangbian, Shuangtan and Dalian
communities, while the Seshui community continues to be fragmented.
After 2013, rural communities entered a period where software
development was the main focus. In 2016, the Rural Community
Regeneration Project 2.0 was produced, a transformation based on the
principles of three livelihood and three agriculture (life, production,
ecology, agriculture, countryside, farmers). At the same time, in 2016,
the Bureau of Soil and Water Conservation of the Council of Agriculture
promoted Taiwan’s rural areas to focus on the three life and future

The research shows, from 2001 to 2020, there are differences in the
changes of landscape spatial patterns in three main classes and four
subclasses of rural communities. Xiao, et al. (2018) found that there are
differences in the landscape patterns of the three rural areas in eastern
China, with Changshu in Jiangsu having the greatest change, followed
by Daxing in Beijing, and Quzhou in Hebei having the least change. This
study has similar conclusions. The process of landscape spatial pattern in
production community (Dalian) is stable. The industry has also played
an important role in spatial evolution. For rural areas with stable
landscape spatial patterns, their economic development depends on the
agricultural industry and lacks endogenous and extrinsic motivation to
promote their development (Xie, et al., 2022b). Van der Sluis,et al.,
(2019a) in their study of agricultural production areas in western
Denmark found that the area of farmland remained stable and that other
land use categories experienced important changes, which is similar to
the results of this study. The progress of landscape spatial pattern in
ecological community (Gangbian) and living community (Shuangtan)
was slow. Xie,et al., (2022b) found in their research on the rural areas of
Guangdong that the rural urban landscape pattern dominated by ecol­
ogy is stable. Due to the influence of topographical factors, the spatial
evolution process is limited, which is similar to the results of this study.
Wang and Wen (2021) found that rural areas tend to have a more stable
landscape spatial pattern, and the agroforestry ecosystem presents a
relatively stable landscape over time. Mountainous areas usually expe­
rience slow land use change and low development density (Ma, et al.,
2018; Xie, et al., 2022b). The year 2013 was a turning point for the
Gangbian, Shuangtan, and Dalian communities, where landscape frag­
mentation was the most prominent. However, the development of the
landscape spatial pattern of living community (Seshui) is unbalanced
and the development speed is relatively fast. Until 2019, it is still in the
development stage of landscape fragmentation, and it is the most
serious. The spatial pattern of landscape in the mid-level area has
changed greatly and has become more diversified (Ma, et al., 2018).
This study believes that the driving forces for the changes in the
landscape spatial pattern of rural communities mainly come from the
policies of the public sector, the spatial planning system (Liu, et al.,
2016; Tu & Chen, 2020), community development activities (van der
Sluis, et al., 2019b). Public participation, coalitions of social organiza­
tions, and financial resources often determine outcomes in landscape
spatial patterns (Hersperger, et al., 2014; van der Sluis, et al., 2019b).
van der Sluis, et al. (2019b) identified two main categories of landscape
drivers in rural Europe: ’policy and legislation’ and ’economy and
markets’. These drivers, although not negative in themselves, have
mostly negative impacts on the landscape, for example, policy and
economic development leading to infrastructure expansion, population
change, and landscape fragmentation. Some policies have obvious pos­
itive effects and will lead to benign developments such as ecotourism.
The development of rural community policies in Taiwan started in
1958. It was not until 2000 that the Amendment to the Regulations on
Agricultural Development was officially passed, which opened up the
free trade of farmland and liberalized the conditions for farmland
transactions and farmhouse construction (Cheng, 2012). Public land has
been transferred to private land, and private land is no longer subject to
government supervision (Tu & Chen, 2020). In 2000, the Agriculture
Committee of the Executive Yuan formulated the “Creating a New Rural
Style Plan”. The plan lasted until 2008, featuring the reconstruction of
rural settlements, improving the rural living environment, assisting in
the construction of a new rural life circle, and shaping a new rural style.
In 2001, the “Measures for Building Farmhouses on Agricultural Land”
was promulgated, which greatly impacted the rural landscape, resulting
in the construction of luxurious farmhouses or small-scale farmhouses.
Then in 2003, the detailed implementation rules for rural land rezoning
were promulgated, with the purpose of land rezoning in rural

planning, and selected gold medal rural activities, thus further pro­
moting rural development. 2016–2019 is the second phase of rural
regeneration. The completed content includes rural manpower and ed­
ucation, and the expansion of the participation of the whole people such
as local governments and non-governmental organizations. To create a
unique style of rural areas, to move towards the core goal of sustainable
and diversified development of rural areas, specially handle the Gold
Medal Rural Competition, and advocate cross-regional development of
rural regeneration. 2020–2023 is the overall development goal of the
third phase of the rural regeneration plan, to create a working coun­
tryside, a living countryside, a guarded countryside and a vibrant
countryside. In addition, the land planning system was formally formed
after the promulgation of the Land Planning Law in 2016. It was revised
in 2020 and is being continuously updated (Zhang, et al., 2020).
Therefore, after 2013, ecological, productive, and living (Shuangtan)
rural communities focused on software development in response to the
promotion of policies and activities such as the Rural Community
Regeneration Plan 2.0 and the changes in the spatial planning system.
The landscape spatial pattern in this stage tends to develop slowly and
improve. However, the fragmentation of landscape in the living com­
munity (Seshui) is the most significant in 2019. On the one hand, in the
Seshui community in recent years, the agricultural industry has
changed, from bamboo and betel nuts as the main product to tea plan­
tations, and betel nut forests have been converted into tea gardens.
Agricultural industry transformation (Ma, et al., 2018) and land use
conversion between farmland, orchards, nurseries, and other productive
lands are the driving forces of rural change (Xiao, et al., 2018). On the
other hand, because it is not far from Sun Moon Lake, it provides
convenient conditions for the development of the homestay industry. As
a result, the growth rate of construction land and transportation land is
rapid, the loss of forest land and farmland is converted into other land
use, etc., and abandoned farmland and idle land have appeared. Li and
Song (2020) and Fan, et al. (2021) pointed out that rural tourism and
farmhouse entertainment, resulting in a large increase in the construc­
tion of new houses, destroyed the original structure of rural settlements,
which is consistent with the results of this study.

certain significance for the maintenance of the ecosystem(Daniels, 1999;
Daniels & Bowers, 1997; Eagle, et al., 2015; Li, 2019). For nonpermanent land use permits, the zoning classification cannot be
changed arbitrarily, and top-down legal management is required. Public
and private ownership of land has been proven to be an important issue
affecting land use change, and private land has a negative impact on the
protection of forests and farmland (Lu & Cheng, 2023; Tu & Chen,
2020). Tu and Chen (2020) pointed out that forest land and slope land
should avoid land privatization. Subsidies and land expropriation for
private agricultural or forest land are active strategies (Cots-Folch, et al.,
2006; Robinson & Brown, 2009; Tu & Chen, 2020). Cots-Folch, et al.
(2006) pointed out that the regulatory policy of the European Union,
subsidizing up to 50 % of terraces and encouraging such activities, has
positive effects on land use transformation. Robinson and Brown (2009)
can have positive effects through meaningful siting expropriation. In
addition, studies have shown that one of the key factors related to the
effectiveness of permanent land policies is the regulation of imple­
mentation by the public sector (Alfasi, et al., 2012; Kline, et al., 2014). It
is necessary to provide supervision mechanisms for rural communities
and higher-level public sector institutions, and conduct supervision and
management on a quarterly basis. These suggested measures can provide
a reference for the formulation of regulations on the spatial planning
system in rural communities in Taiwan.
4.4. Research limitations
The limitations of this research stem from the image data. (1) The
time of the aerial image drawings of the four rural communities is not
uniform, which is limited by cloud cover and public image data. (2) The
source of the aerial image drawing is not the same month or season, and
the land cover will be slightly different due to the influence of seasonal
climate, for example, the influence of seasons on water volume and
vegetation. (3) The impact on land cover will be slightly different due to
the difference in the age of trees. For example, the trees in the early
years, due to artificial planting, present an array layout, so they will be
classified as farmland. However, today, as time goes by, the trees grow
up and are classified as forest land from remote sensing images.
Therefore, there are certain research limitations in the digitalization
stage of the four stages of landscape spatial pattern change analysis.

4.3. Rural community development advice
The public sector needs to regulate the rural household registration
population, and allocate suitable rural residential areas according to the
needs of the rural population. Enhance land regulation through
restrictive policies regulating residential land supply (Fan, et al., 2021;
Heins, 2004; Li & Song, 2020; Liu, et al., 2014). Looking at the changes
in the total population of the four rural communities, the rural popu­
lation has gradually decreased due to industrialization and urbanization
(Liu, et al., 2014). However, the research results show that the con­
struction land is constantly increasing, which contradicts the reduction
of the population, and this transformation is also somewhat destructive.
It is very necessary to accurately locate the development types of
rural communities (ecological, productive and living community). The
development of ecotourism in rural communities can balance ecology
and economy, and it has been proved to have positive benefits for forest
regeneration, which is an appropriate way to achieve sustainable
development (Arif, et al., 2022; Tu & Chen, 2020).
It is necessary to establish legal norms for permanent land policies in
rural communities and strengthen law enforcement and supervision by
public departments. The permanent land policy of rural communities is
legally regulated, and it is necessary to delineate specific areas as per­
manent farmland, forest land, water area and ecological protection land,
and it is forbidden to change the nature of land use and prohibit
development and construction. In addition, refine the strategy of per­
manent farmland, forest land, water area and ecological protection land,
and build high-quality land use areas. Permanent farmland conservation
policies are the most commonly used land use tool to combat land use
conversion. This measure can limit the fragmentation of the land and has

5. Conclusions
From 2001 to 2020, land use change in four different types of rural
communities has common ground. (1) From the perspective of land use
analysis, the growth of construction land and transportation land in the
four communities is a common phenomenon. The growth rate of con­
struction and transportation land matches the type of rural community.
(2) From the perspective of land cover types, forest land or farmland in
each community is the most important land cover, but each community
has its characteristics. (3) From the perspective of land transfer analysis,
the mutual conversion and loss of farmland, forest land, and other land
use.
This study believes that the driving forces for the changes in the
landscape spatial pattern of rural communities mainly come from the
policies of the public sector, the spatial planning system, community
development activities. (1) Before 2007, living, ecological, and pro­
duction rural communities focused on hardware development, and the
land conversion was relatively large. At this stage, the landscape spatial
pattern was in a development stage that tended to be fragmented. (2) By
2013, rural communities were in a transition period from hardware to
software. At this stage, the landscape spatial pattern is still in a stage of
fragmented development. The landscape fragmentation phenomenon is
most obvious in the Gangbian, Shuangtan and Dalian communities,
while the Seshui community continues to be fragmented. (3) After 2013,
rural communities focused on software development. The landscape
spatial pattern in this stage tends to develop slowly and improve.

F. Ning et al.

However, the landscape fragmentation of the living community
(Shishui) will be the most significant in 2019.
It is suggested that for the development of rural communities in
Taiwan in the future, rural communities need the regulation of the rural
registered population by the public sector, and allocate suitable rural
residential areas according to the needs of the rural population. Rural
communities need an accurate definition of the type of development.
Rural communities need to establish legal norms for permanent land
policies and strengthen law enforcement and supervision by the public
sector.

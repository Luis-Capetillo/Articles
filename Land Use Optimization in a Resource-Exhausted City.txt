Abstract: Limited land resources are used to meet the growing economic, social, and ecological needs
of people in China. Food, energy, and water (F-E-W) are the basic resources for supporting human
survival and the transformation of different land uses. This paper tries to construct a theoretical
framework of land use and the F-E-W nexus and uses system dynamics to simulate the optimal
allocation of land use in Shizuishan City, China, by comparing different scenarios that have different
parameters related to F-E-W. The final results follow: (1) according to the relationship between land
use and the F-E-W nexus, a three-layer nested theoretical framework is constructed. (2) Future
land use under different scenarios differs. Under the scenarios of a less dependence on coal energy,
a higher utilization efficiency of energy and agricultural water resources, and a lower grain selfsufficiency rate, there are less crop and urban lands but more ecological land. However, generally
speaking, crop and rural construction lands tend to decrease, while urban and ecological lands tend
to increase. (3) Combined with different objectives, the rapid transformation scenario is considered
a better option in which to achieve a balance among the economy, society, and ecology. This paper
also discusses the application of land use optimization in the delineation of three control lines in
territory-space planning in China.

Land is one of the most important material foundations for human survival and development [1,2]. Due to the process of China’s rapid economic development and urbanization,
a large area of crop land was transformed into construction land. In contrast, because of the
increase in population and the improvement in people’s living standards, food demands
are increasing [3]. To ensure food security, there must be sufficient crop land for food
production. Ecological land, a land use category that provides considerable ecological
value, is decreasing in area because of its transformation into construction land or crop
land, which leads to a decline in ecological function [4–6]. The scarcity of land resources,
the multifunctionality of land use, and the unlimited demand for land require land use
optimization so as to promote a high-quality urban development, ensure food security, and
realize an ecological civilization. Sustainable land use does not mean to simply meet the
needs of human economic development through land development; more importantly, it
establishes a long-term balance between economic development, environmental protection,
and social equity [7]. In the 17 Sustainable Development Goals formulated by the United
Nations in 2015, there are significant challenges and intrinsic tradeoffs that arise from the
interaction of social and environmental systems [8]. Particularly, the food, energy, and
water (F-E-W) nexus is central to the sustainability question [9,10].
The concept of the F-E-W nexus became popular after the Bonn2011 Nexus
Conference [11]. Future Earth (2014–2023), a ten-year scientific project initiated by the
International Science Council and the International Social Science Council, set up a network

resources, the recoverable energy reserves of Shizuishan decreased, and even began to
diminish, which had a massive impact on Shizuishan, where industry was extremely
dependent on coal [29]. In 2008, Shizuishan City was listed in the first batch of resourceexhausted cities in China. A resource-exhausted city is a type of resource-based city
where accumulative recovered reserves of mineral resources already exceeded 70% of
the recoverable reserves [30]. The depletion of coal energy and the restriction of mining
meant a reduction in job opportunities, which meant that much of the local industrial
population began to leave Shizuishan [31]; however, urban construction land remains in a
state of growth, inevitably occupying crop and ecological land. Due to China’s crop-land
dynamic balance policy (according to the amount of crop land occupied by construction,
the same quantity of crop land must be added), crop land areas continue to increase rapidly.
Ultimately, this means that the area of ecological land is decreasing.

2.2. Methods
System dynamics (SD) is a method of studying the dynamic behavior of information
feedback systems, based on the feedback-control theory [32], which was first created by
Forrest in 1956 [33]. Many scholars applied system dynamics to the study of the F-E-W
nexus [34,35]. Land space is composed of many complex subsystems, and each subsystem
consists of numerous elements, including F-E-W resources and different land use patterns.
The interconnection, restriction, and feedback between F-E-W reflect the characteristics
of the system, and F-E-W are all related to land use. It is necessary to use the system
theory to summarize the complex relationship between the subsystems and land space to
provide more reasonable planning and optimization for future land use. SD can accurately
reflect the dynamic characteristics of a land use system. Considering that China’s land use
planning especially emphasizes quantity control of land use, and that SD can simulate a
future land use scale, SD is therefore an effective tool for land use planning and allocation.
2.3. Model Developed Based on SD
In the process of land use planning modeling using SD, this report refers to some
existing models [36,37]. F-E-W nexus is not involved in the cited articles. We worked to
integrate the F-E-W nexus into the land use planning model. The collected historical data on
the local population, food, water, land, etc. was used to help establish variable relationships.
The land use optimization or planning model consists of five subsystems. As noted, the
F-E-W nexus is closely related to land; thus, our model includes four subsystems: energy,
food, water, and land use. This report also sets up an urban-rural integration subsystem. In
this model (Figure 6), the subsystems are interdependent. Economic development needs to
consume energy, which will lead to an increase in the local mining land and affects the land

2.3.1. Energy Subsystem
Considering that the main energy sources in Shizuishan are coal and coke, and that
diesel and natural gas are also important energy sources in Shizuishan, the proportion of
coal/coke/diesel/natural gas in the energy structure, and their consumption demands
are considered here. Renewable energy is used sparingly in Shizuishan and its carbon
emissions are low; thus, the energy footprint here does not include renewable energy. GDP
is an important economic index. The development level of the secondary and tertiary
industries mainly reflects the development of the urban economy, while the development
of the primary industry is mainly concentrated in rural areas, which will bring about a
disparity in GDP among the population and in the land between urban and rural areas.
Economic development leads to energy consumption, and the consumption of fossil energy
releases greenhouse gases and pollutants. The energy footprint reflects the land area

Here, the traditional method is used; that is, the required forest area is used to represent
the energy footprint [39] (Figure 7).

2.3.3. Water Subsystem
In the water subsystem, the water supply mainly meets water demands for industry,
urban and rural domestic supply, agriculture, and ecological needs. Agricultural water
consumption is the main form of water demand in Shizuishan, within which irrigation
water consumption for crop land is the largest proportion used, and so only the water
demand of crop land is considered here. The supply of ecological water is elastic. At
present, China lacks clear and operable rules or methods for determining the quantity and
quality of ecological water, which makes the supply of ecological water uncertain [40].
Forest coverage is an important indicator of eco-environmental capacity and ecological
carrying capacity. According to the law of regional differentiation, forest landscapes are
difficult to cultivate in arid and semi-arid areas unless water resources meet the needs of
a forest. Once water resources are insufficient, the forest quickly degenerates into barren
sandy land [41]. Forests play an important role in CO2 absorption, and thus, the traditional
method comprises using woodland areas needed to absorb CO2 emitted by fuel combustion
to characterize the energy footprint [42,43] (Figure 9).
2.3.4. Urban-Rural Integration Subsystem and Land Use Subsystem
The last two subsystems are the urban-rural integration subsystem and the land use
subsystem. The urban-rural integration subsystem focuses on changes in the urban and
rural populations while the land use subsystem mainly describes the transformation in
different land types. The land use types of Shizuishan are mainly divided into urban land,
rural construction land, crop land, and ecological land. Urban land also contains mining
land. Ecological land includes woodland and grassland, which also have agricultural value.
Other land types include water conservancy land, traffic land, and some special lands. In
the past, change in other land areas was not obvious and showed no obvious trend. This
change, however, is less relevant to F-E-W, so it is set as a fixed value here—37,724.3 ha,
which comprises the total land area.

GDP, industrial energy consumption, and energy types also came from the ‘Shizuishan
statistic yearbook (2010–2020)’; while the data for different uses of water came from the
‘Water resources bulletin of Ningxia Autonomous Region (2015–2020)’. The initial state of the
model was 2019, which simulated 2020–2035, and the historical data from 2010–2019 were
used to help establish variable relationships.
The iThink software has a “Check Units” function that was used to track and check
the accuracy of the simulation model’s equation expression. The test results show that the
values of each element do not appear abnormal and that the dimensions of the equation
are consistent.
A sensitivity analysis function is used to observe the influence of the numerical change
of a certain parameter on the system. The sensitivity (S) is calculated as:
S = ∆Q/Q0 × X0 /∆X

(1)

where X0 and Q0 are the values of the parameters and the output state variables under the
initial conditions, respectively; ∆X and ∆Q are the absolute value of the parameter change
and the absolute value of the output state variable change caused by parameter change,
respectively. If the parameter of an auxiliary variable changes greatly, but the change in the
critical output variable in the system is very small, this means that the auxiliary variable is
not sensitive. In this report, the coal energy consumption ratio, energy consumption per
unit GDP, comprehensive irrigation quota, water consumption per unit industrial output
value, and grain self-sufficiency rate were selected as important parameters; crop land,
urban land, ecological land, forest, and new mining land were selected as state variables.
The sensitivity of five important parameters was obtained by analyzing the changes in the
five output variables, showing a change of 10% in 2035 (See Table 1).

When the parameter changes by 10%, the average change in all output state variables
is less than 10%, and the sensitivity coefficient is less than 1, indicating that the model has
a good robustness. In addition, consistency analysis indicated the absolute value of the
relative error of 90% of the model’s predictions were within 5%, which implies that the
model fits the historical data quite well.
2.5. Scenario Design
According to the sensitivity analysis, the coal energy consumption ratio, energy
consumption per unit GDP, comprehensive irrigation quota, and grain self-sufficiency
rate have a more significant impact on land variables. These parameters are selected for
setting scenario setting parameters. At the same time, according to the local national
economic and social development plan, agricultural plan, and an investigation by local
government officials, we set different scenarios where different parameters related to the
F-E-W nexus are combined. Scenario 1 is conservative with parameters close to actual
values. Scenario 3 reflects the development demands for rapid urban transformation in
local planning. Scenario 2 is a moderate transition scenario (Table 2).

Scenario 1:
Conservative scenario: the energy structure is still dominated by coal. The energy
consumption per unit GDP is similar to that of the existing level: it maintains a high rate of
grain self-sufficiency and a high grain yield. In agriculture, flood irrigation with Yellow
River water is still the main irrigation method, and existing paddy fields are maintained,
meaning that irrigation water consumption remains large.
Scenario 2:
Smooth transition scenario: in terms of the energy structure, the proportion of coal
is moderately reduced and energy consumption per GDP is steadily reduced. The grain
self-sufficiency rate is maintained, and water-saving agriculture is popularized locally.
Scenario 3:
Rapid transformation scenario: in terms of the energy structure, the dependence
on coal resources is rapidly changed and renewable energy is developed by relying on
abundant local wind resources and solar energy resources. Industrial transformation is
accelerated, reducing the proportion of high-energy consuming enterprises, and improving
the entry threshold of energy consumption. It is also necessary to reduce grain production
and support the development of the animal husbandry industry in accordance with the
local agricultural “14th Five-Year Plan”. To improve the efficiency of water resources
utilization in agriculture, there is a need to vigorously promote water-saving agriculture.
3. Results
3.1. Land Use Simulation Results
In scenario 3 (the rapid transformation scenario), the area of crop land is the smallest, while in scenario 1 (the conservative scenario), the area of crop land is the largest
(Figure 13). This is mainly because reducing grain self-sufficiency leads to diminishing
demand for crop land. Additionally, reducing irrigation quota, which improves water
resources utilization efficiency, can increase ecological water use supply and, thus, reduce
agriculture production risks. In scenario 1, crop land area decreases to the lowest area
of 86,626 hectares in 2023, increases to 90,842 hectares in 2029, and then fluctuates. In
scenario 3, the crop land area drops to the lowest area of 69,408 hectares in 2025, continues
to rise to 73,936 hectares in 2029, and then decreases. Scenario 2 shows a similar trend; this
is because, according to the calculation of the area of existing crop land, the amount of
food that can be produced exceeds the demand. At that time, some crop land needs to be
converted into ecological land.
In scenario 3, the area of ecological land is the largest, while in scenario 1, the area of
ecological land is the smallest (Figure 14). The reason for this is similar to the previous
analysis, because in scenario 3, much crop land becomes ecological land, and less ecological
land is occupied as crop land. Additionally, reducing the proportion of coal energy increases
ecological land by diminishing the area occupied by mining activities. At the same time,
the change trend of ecological land area corresponds to crop land.

ture production risks. In scenario 1, crop land area decreases to the lowest area of 86,626
hectares in 2023, increases to 90,842 hectares in 2029, and then fluctuates. In scenario 3, the
crop land area drops to the lowest area of 69,408 hectares in 2025, continues to rise to
73,936 hectares in 2029, and then decreases. Scenario 2 shows a similar trend; this is because, according to the calculation of the area of existing crop land, the amount of13food

In the past five years and before, both urban land and rural construction land showed
an increasing trend. Urban sprawl occupied much land for urban development; at the same
time, the speed of reclamation of rural construction land was slower than the increasing
speed of rural construction land. Previously, the existence of the crop land dynamic balance
policy caused crop land to increase continually. The increase in construction land and crop
land caused ecological land to decrease continuously.
Based on the interconnection between the F-E-W nexus and land, the land use simulation for the next 15 years is closely based on crop land planning around food demand.
Under the conditions of meeting this demand, crop land is converted to ecological land,
and the urban land area is simulated and combined with future energy structure changes.
At the same time, it assumes that future rural construction land area will be inevitably
reduced. When setting the change in rural land reduction, it should be linked with the level
of rural population reduction and the area of crop land occupied by construction lands.
Different land use simulations for each scenario are given in the Appendix A
(Tables A1–A3).
3.2. Scenario Comparisons
3.2.1. Food Safety
The gap between the crop land area needed for food consumption and the actual crop
land area (i.e., pressure index of crop land) can be used to reflect food security [46,47].
Due to the change in population during Shizuishan’s history, the current crop land area
in Shizuishan is greater than its demand, and thus, more crop land will be transformed
into ecological land. Under scenario 1, the grain self-sufficiency rate is higher, and the risk
of ecological deterioration to grain production is greater. The gap is slightly larger than

that under the other scenarios, resulting in a greater pressure on crop land. The gap under

such as GIS-linked Bayesian belief networks (BBN) [51] and GISCAME [52] are also good
for spatial simulations. Compared with that of these methods, SD can show the complex
dynamic changes and internal feedback mechanism of the system, while BBN may represent
a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via directed acyclic graphs and
attempt to reduce complexity [53]. However, in data-scarce areas, the use of SD models
will be limited.
In fact, land spatial data will enrich the research content. Land cover and land use
accounts, based on the System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA), were
implemented in Europe, the US, and other countries [54–56]. Based on spatial information,
land cover and land use accounts can be as detailed as possible according to the resolution
of the satellite data input. Other accounts, such as the land change matrix based on spatial
data, can better present the area of different land types at the beginning of the reference
period (opening stock), the net increases and net decreases according to the land type it
was converted from (in the case of increases), or what it was converted to (in the case of
decreases) [57].
5. Conclusions
We give attention to the production, supply, distribution and consumption of food,
energy, and water (F-E-W) resources, which affect the change in land use and optimize
land allocation from the perspective of the F-E-W nexus and its interconnection with
land to promote high-quality urban development, ensure food security, and realize an
ecological civilization.
We built a three-layer nested theoretical framework including F-E-W, different land
use, and multiobjective according to the relationship between land use and the F-E-W
nexus. Energy, food, and water resources are interconnected; urban land, crop land, and
ecological land are also interrelated and can be converted into one another. The association
between different elements or objectives is not one-way, but rather is bidirectional.
In this paper, Shizuishan is taken as an example to explore its mechanism of influence
on land use change by using the F-E-W nexus and system dynamics. According to different
scenarios, future land use changes are different: the overall situation shows that the urban
land grows more steadily; crop land decreases to its lowest point, and then fluctuates;
ecological land increases to its peak, and then fluctuates; and rural construction land
decreases continuously. In the conservative scenario, the area of crop land and urban
land is the largest in the next 15 years, and ecological land is the smallest. In the rapid
transformation scenario, the area of crop land and urban land is the smallest, and the area
of ecological land is the largest, while the smooth transition scenario represents the middle
option for land use changes. The results of the simulation of different land use scenarios
in the future and historical land use change show different trends as we set parameters
and variable relations according to the F-E-W nexus to correct unreasonable land use in
the past. Combined with the different objectives of urban development, food security, and
ecological civilization, the rapid transformation scenario is considered the best to achieve a
balance of economy, society, and ecology.
Some contributions arise from our study. Firstly, the model used in this work enables
local management authorities to simulate future trends in land use change. Secondly, in
land use planning, planners should give attention to the impacts of the F-E-W nexus on
land use, rather than consider the effect of certain resources on land use in isolation. Finally,
the F-E-W nexus refers not only to the interdependence of resources but also to the tradeoff
of policies between different departments. In the context of institutional restructuring of
China’s natural resources sector, our research calls on the various sectors—land, water,
agriculture, and energy—to strengthen cooperation in the process of spatial planning to
make it more scientific and rational.
Future research needs to focus on how to optimize land use layouts and to combine
them with existing research results from the quantity scaling of land use. The land use types

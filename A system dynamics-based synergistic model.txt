Abstract
Human-land coordination represents urbanization and is a key component of urban modernization. In this study, the theory of system dynamics was introduced, in which a "productionliving-ecological" complex system was used based on the human-land coordination concept. Moreover, the characteristics of system dynamics of causal cycle, dynamic and sustainable development, man-land synergy, integrity and openness, and self-organization and
adaptability were analyzed by dividing it into three subsystems: urban production, urban living, and urban ecological subsystems. Here, causal feedback and system structure flow diagrams were designed using causal loop diagrams and system structure flow diagrams to
evaluate the causal relationships between variables and quantitatively analyzing their interactions between variables and predicting the future development of variables. Changsha
City, China was selected as the case study area, where we constructed system dynamics
practice equation model was then constructed to determine the interaction between the subsystems. Our findings indicate that by the year 2035 in the future, the overall trend of factors
influencing the function of the subsystems such as population, GDP and built-up area are
positively correlated with an increasing trend, and there are interactions between. Furthermore, these factors interact with each other, and a mutual correlation was found among the
production-living-ecological functions system, Therefore, this study provides a novel perspective and exploratory practice for the study of the synergistic coupling of ecological, production, and living functions of cities and evaluating high-quality development of cities.
Thus, the coupling and coordination of urban production, living and ecological functions
reflects the coupling and coordination of the "people-land" relationship, which is the key to
high-quality urban development.

Introduction
In 2022, the Chinese government proposed a people- centered approach to urbanization,
which incorporates a regional economic and territorial space structure to support high-quality
development. Urbanization promotes coordinated regional development and fosters an

improved quality of life for the people. It involves the spatial expansion of cities and towns and
modernization of systems and cultures [1–3]. Hence, the "human-land" relationship is considered as an essential tool to identify approaches to high-quality development of urban areas
[4–7]. The human-land relation demonstrates a complementary relationship between human
economic activities and environmental resource capacity [4,8,9]. Furthermore, in terms of
urban function, it reflects the degree of rationalization and efficiency of "production, living
and ecology" functions in the city [10,11]. By understanding the coordinated developments
between the subsystems of the "production-living-ecological", proper urban development can
be achieved [12–14]. However, for a long time, the accelerated process of urbanization has put
serious pressure on the ecological space of cities and human production activities, such as the
uncontrolled expansion of construction land, have continuously caused negative impacts on
the ecological environment. This has resulted in the trade-offs and incoherence between the
"production-life-ecology" functions of cities, and has attracted the attention of many scholars
[15,16].
Since 2012, research on the "production-living-ecological" system has gained attention. The
concept includes three primary aspects: The first is the definition of the connotation of the
"production-living-ecological" functions and the construction of the index system and the
evaluation based on the index system [17–20]. The second is to analyze the relationship
between the coordination characteristics of the "production-living-ecological" functions and
land planning [21]. Scholars such as Zhang Z, Shan Y, and Ni W quantitatively analyzed the
process of mutual influence of transformation and coupling coordination among the "production-living-ecological" functions and proposed the theory that production functions determine
living functions and living functions influence ecological functions. For example, the alpine
grassland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau need to realize the coordinated development of ecological, production, and living functions of the alpine grassland ecosystem by regulating the
population carrying capacity according to the mutual influence mechanism and reasonable
proportional structure of the production-living-ecological functions [22–25]. Lastly, identifying and analyzing the "production-living-ecological" space using the land functions perspective
[26]. For instance, Fu [27]and Heng et al [28,29]. used the "production-living-ecological" and
found out that there was a poor overall spatial arrangement, in which spatial functions were
not complementary and integrated.
Several studies like those of Hu et al [30]. have adopted research methods from other disciplines to examine the national spatial data. Here, the systems theory was used to understand
the wetland production-living-ecological complex system and its synergies. Meanwhile, Gu
et al [31]. used the system dynamics theory to predict the urbanization rate of China in the
next 50 years, while Yi et al [32]. also adopted the same theory in municipal territorial spatial
planning. Hence, system dynamics can be a suitable approach in predicting future development changes and solving complex nonlinear system problems, using scenario simulations
and models that combine qualitative and quantitative data on various system levels and their
interactions.
Generally, existing studies on the coordination of production-living-ecological functions
have been performed from a systematic perspective. However, these have been primarily
focused on the internal mechanisms of human-land relationship coordination [33,34], and
strategies to promote the coordination, balance and sustainable development of geographical
environment and human well-being [35,36]. Meanwhile, research particularly focused on the
coordination between human and "production-living-ecological" functions have remained
lacking, in which only few studies have attempted to combine only two of the "production-living-ecological" functions, and urban ecology, production, living functions. The projections of
the interrelationships between the "production-life-ecology" functions of the future city are

limited, which does not provide recommendations for the future development of the city and
alerts for risk avoidance. Moreover, urban ecology, production, living functions, and their correlation to the people have not been extensively explored under the system dynamics framework. This study uses the theoretical framework of the human-earth system. It also applies the
system dynamics theory [37] using a holistic-systems thinking approach to develop the complex "production-living-ecological" system, consisted of the urban production, living, and ecology systems. Using Changsha City, China, as a case study area, we employ system dynamics
modeling to project the future development of production, living, and ecological functions
within the city. By exploring the external characterization of the system layer by layer to the
internal structure of the system, the operation mechanism of the integrated state of the urban
human-land coupling and coordination relationship is obtained.[38]. It is expected that this
study may provide valuable insights and recommendations to improve the spatial governance
of Changsha and develop a theoretical framework for new urbanization approaches.

Material and methods
Study area and data sources
Changsha City is in the northeastern portion of Hunan Province in China (Fig 1, created using
ARCGIS 10.2), covers an area of 11,819 km2. It is an important node city of the central urban
agglomeration of the Yangtze River and the Yangtze River Economic Belt. It includes six districts, with one county and two county-level cities, such as Yuelu, Yuhua, Furong, Tianxin,
Kaifu, and Wangcheng District and Changsha County, as well as Liuyang City and Ningxiang
City so it has an outstanding locational advantage. In 2020, it had a population of approximately 10 million, increasing by 42.71% over the last decade. In 2020 gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2020 was 1214.252 billion yuan, signifying a 4% increase relative to its previous year
[39,40], well above the provincial average. Additionally, Changsha serves as a pivotal grain production center in China and a testing ground for the comprehensive reform of the "two-oriented society" [41]. Furthermore, its historical and cultural significance further underscores its
research value. For a special human geographic unit such as Changsha, as the core growth pole
of economic development in Hunan Province, it is extremely important to implement qualitative and quantitative research on the prediction of the future development of its urban "production-life-ecology". In China, there are many Chinese cities that are similar to Changsha in
terms of geographic location, resources, and economic development, similar geographic units
to Changsha City also include Wuhan and Suzhou, especially Wuhan, which shares many similarities with Changsha in terms of geographic location, ecological environment, and economic
development, and many scholars have also focused on the development of Wuhan’s "production-life-ecology" space. For example, scholars used a system dynamics model to study the
coordination of the "production-life-ecology" space in Wuhan and Suzhou [42,43]. Based on
the previous studies, the importance of Changsha’s geographic location and its rapid economic
and social development make it feasible research area for this study, and the study of Changsha
can provide a reference for the development of Chinese cities.
The model data were obtained from the Statistical Yearbook of Hunan Province and the
Statistical Yearbook of Changsha City for the period 2010–2019.

Methods
Qualitative and quantitative analyses were used to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the
production-living-ecology system, including its structure and subsystems and their interactions, and predict future development changes in the subsystems.

A composite system is a high-level system generated from the coupling of two or more systems, in which the original system is considered as one of its subsystems. Here, various interactions between the elements occur [44,45]. Specifically, a coupled coordination not only
represents the state of the system, but also its imposed role on the system. Coordination in the

former refers to the harmonious relationship between various elements, including their cooperation, complementarity, and synergy that allows the system to maintaining an optimum
overall effect or function [46]. Using this qualitive relationship, Fig 2 shows the relationship
between human-land coordination and prime urban functions development.
Production function involves the utilization of land as the means of labor to directly generate a wide array of products and services, such as the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries to provide residents with the supplies and services needed for production and life
including the financial and insurance services industry to provide as a subdivision of the production function. In addition, the life function refers to the various spatial bearings, material
and spiritual security functions provided by the land during the process of human survival and
development. The life function refers to the various spatial carrying, material and spiritual protection functions provided by the land in the process of human survival and development. It
includes elements like leisure, which contributes to people’s well-being by offering relaxation
and enhancing their overall quality of life. Additionally, it involves the consumption function,
facilitating shopping and consumption for city residents. Both leisure and consumption functions are subdivisions of the life function. Lastly, the ecological function relates to the ecosystems and ecological processes that sustain the natural conditions necessary for human survival
and well-being. This encompasses ecological scenic areas, parks, and green spaces that maintain a vital ecological environment for both life and work [47,48].
1. "Causal cycle" characteristics of the urban "production-living-ecological" system
The urban system is composed of multiple elements that interact and overlap each other,
forming complex causal relationships. This causal relationship is the basic law of urban systems and considered as the basic unit for analyzing urban complex systems. The economist

Gonna Murdar stated that urban systems involved a process of continuous evolution, in which
technological, social, economic, and cultural factors, among the few, contribute to this as interrelating, and mutually influencing and causal factors that form a vicious cycle with cumulative
effects [49]. As cities, production, living, and ecological factors also interact with each other in
the "production-living-ecological" system, a vicious cycle may occur in cases where one factor
is mismanaged. For instance, an uncoordinated development of urban life and production factors may lead to a destruction of ecological factors, which may consequently affect production
development. Furthermore, a poor environment condition may lead to lesser business investments. Poor development and utilization of land use affects the potential overall quality of life
of the population, owing to reduced happiness and increased disease incidence. Consequently,
this lowers the capacity for improving and protecting ecological spaces, as financial and material resource investments are also reduced, forming a vicious circle. Hence, analyzing the
urban complex system in consideration with the mutual causality between urban subsystems
based on the current urban development conditions is necessary.
2. Dynamics and Sustainable Development Characteristics of the Urban " production-living-ecological " System
Cities are inherently influenced by internal and external factors and are constantly moving
and changing. In the process of development, negative impacts such as environmental pollution, pressure on urban infrastructure, and housing constraints arise from the disruption of
urban system functions, in which it consequently leads to economic, social, and ecological
imbalances and threaten sustainable urban development. Impacts such as these are also simultaneously coupled with the increasing intensity of anthropogenic activities, which further
obscures the boundaries between the interacting subsystems [50,51]. Sustainable development
of cities requires a coordinated development of the urban production, living, and ecological
elements, ensuring that immediate and long-term interests are accounted for and the degree of
development of each element and their interaction with the other elements are understood to
ensure synergy between these elements within the entire system.
3. People and place synergy in the urban "production-living-ecological" system
The urban "production-living-ecological" system consists of various synergies among its
subsystems and elements. It is essentially considered as a human-land relationship system as
the "production-living-ecological" comprise the environmental elements, while the various
activities occurring comprise the "human elements". Here, the overall stability is dependent of
the level of coordination between and among these elements. For instance, a carrying capacity
exists for environmental elements, in which a potential irreversible collapse may occur as a
result of intensive human activities. Hence, a balance between these elements requires a harmonious coexistence and interaction between human and land [52]. This relationship also
comprises the various functions of the subsystems within the human-land system [53], in
which the production, living, and ecological spatial subsystems form a feedback system that is
essential to understanding how the complex urban system can be optimally managed. In addition, understanding its historical evolution process is also required as it may serve as basis for
potential urban development strategies, accounting for the driving mechanism of change
through time. This is also to ensure that an objective approach is taken and potential personal
interests in urban development are eliminated to ensure the achievement of sustainable urban
development.
4. Integrity and openness of the urban "production-living-ecological" system
A city is the center of human life and business production. It is an open system as exchanges
of internal elements between its internal and external areas are constantly and continuously
occurring. In this process, unfavorable exchange conditions inevitably arise that makes the
entire urban system function in both order and disorder. An open system tends to be

disorderly as collisions such as urban political territory and urban identity issues occur and
disrupt its equilibrium [54]. Therefore, a disorderly state can be transformed into an orderly
state by coordinating the various elements, particularly the production, living, and ecology elements. A higher degree of decrease in disorder of the system requires a higher degree of coordination [54]. In this study, the urban area of Changsha was also considered as an open
system, in which its internal "production-living-ecological" functions was attempted to be
coordinated to ensure that an optimal orderly state is achieved, in addition to maintaining an
efficient material and energy exchange between its internal and external urban areas.
5. Self-adaptability and self-organization of the urban "production-living-ecological" system
Composite systems are a combination of natural and man-made systems, in which it has
the ability to both self-organize and regulate while also being externally regulated and managed
through the introduction of various methods. Urban composite systems possess a characteristic of these two systems, where it can self-organize as a result of various human activities
[55,56]. Hence, a coordinated and balanced human production activity with ecological buffers
ensure the capability of the system to self-organize and regulate. However, when human interests such as those activities involving the prioritization of higher economic gains without consideration of the resource carrying capacity, urban economic destabilization and ecological
imbalance ensue [57], which consequently affects the self-adaptive capacity of the urban system. To avoid this, urban systems must be allowed to recover and self-organize using appropriate land planning and management.
Through the qualitative analysis mentioned above, from a systemic point of view, in the
process of urban development, cities have the characteristics of a systemic "cause and effect
cycle", dynamics and sustainable development, synergy between people and land, wholeness
and openness, as well as self-adaptation and self-organization, which clearly determine the
fundamental problems of the city. To gain a clear understanding of fundamental urban issues,
we must initiate our analysis from within the city’s internal structure, while duly considering
all constituent elements of the "people" and "land" relationship.

Quantitative analysis of the urban complex production-living-ecology
system
As an urban system is complex with multiple components and dynamic interconnections, a
single qualitative analysis cannot solely determine its behavioral and functional characteristics.
This study explores the coupling and coordination of the "production-living-ecological" system in Changsha to determine the dynamics of the production-living-ecology system by constructing a composite system. It also aims to predict the changes of variables such as GDP in
the model using quantitative analysis, as changes in GDP affect fiscal revenues that determines
the amount of resource allocation for urban green space areas, including pertinent ecological
indicators.
1. Causal feedback flow chart
The mechanism of interaction between the living and production subsystem involves provision of the necessary material materials for the living by the production, while the living subsystem concurrently provides the necessary labor for the production, in addition to acting as
consumers as well. Hence, a satisfactory living can consequently improve the production
efficiency.
Meanwhile, the production subsystem produces solid, gas, and liquid wastes, that are
excreted from production areas to the ecological environment. This causes ecological environmental pollution. However, improving production benefits may also provide the necessary
economic support to further protect the physical environment and its ecological functions,

because only with a developed economy and increased financial revenues, people’s investment
in ecological protection increases relatively. Among other things, a developed economy can
also lead to a higher environmental awareness among its people.
The mechanism of interaction between the ecological and living subsystems involves the
provision of a good living environment for the people, resulting in an improved quality of life
and happiness. Consequently, the former also affects the latter through generation of domestic
garbage that reduces the quality of living function.
Based on these feedback systems, the Vensim PLE software was used to analyze the causal
feedback flow diagram of the of production, living, and ecological subsystems in Changsha, as
shown in Fig 3.
2. System structure flow diagram
The causal feedback loop diagram depicts the fundamental linkages and causal interconnections between subsystems, whereas system dynamics flow diagrams are needed for a more indepth analysis of the interactions of the system’s components and the forecasting of the system’s future. Referring to previous studies, the variables in the model below were selected. The
Vensim PLE software-based production-living-ecological system flow diagram for the city is
displayed (Fig 4). Based on this, the framework for the production-living-ecology complex system dynamics model was built.
3. System dynamics equation
The urban production-living-ecology system is characterized by a complex and dynamic
cause-effect cycle, integrity and openness, self-organization, and self-adaptive system dynamics. These complexities have a significant impact on development and human-earth synergy.
Hence, general mathematical methods were not sufficient to provide quantitative and accurate
descriptions and analysis. For instance, the "production-living-ecological" coupling formula
can only examine the level of reciprocal coupling among urban systems, but cannot accurately

forecast future system evolution. Instead, we employed a system dynamics model, which linearly analyses GDP, total population, landscaped area, and arable land as the influencing factors
was linearly analyzed to provide a more accurate representation of the complex relationship
between the subsystems. Here, that the state variables of production, living and ecosystem
were interrelated and mutually exclusive and were derived from advanced artificial determination. Based on a large body of literature, the correlation between similar measures of "production-life-ecology" in Chinese cities has been confirmed by numerous studies. The system
dynamics equations as detailed in (Table 1), describe the quantitative interrelationships
between variables in the structural flow diagram of a system using historical data fitting variables of Changsha, the current data was used to predict and analyze future conditions in 2035.
The results of the simulation part of the system dynamics simulation were compared and
analyzed with the existing historical data to test the reliability of the model. However, owing to
the complexity of the model and large number of variables, this study focused on the historical
verification of the changes in the total population, built-up area, arable land area, GDP, and
landscaped area of Changsha City. The errors between the simulated data and the actual data
were mostly within 10%, and the model exhibited a relatively reliable result (Table 2).

material conditions for urban development, and it has a non-negligible influence on the other
subsystems in the model. It encompasses all the primary economic production function of the
country, including both direct and indirect economic productions. The former refers to all
areas that directly generate goods and services such as agricultural lands, whereas the latter
refers to all areas used for intermediate transport and housing of these goods and services such
as urban construction areas. As Changsha City is mainly an industrial area, it is primarily composed of areas under indirect production [58,59].
Human activities are fundamentally driven by addressing human needs, making them integral to the indirect production process. In recent years, the production space in Changsha City
has been mainly shaped by the secondary and tertiary industries. The development of the secondary and tertiary industries relies on the development of high-quality talents and basic labor
force, as well as tourism consumption due to increase in population. These factors are closely
related to living space and ecological space. Consequently, the internal structure of the production subsystem should be appropriately coordinated with the ecological and living subsystems
to provide a better material basis for a more optimum living function balanced with green ecological function.
Living subsystem of Changsha City. The living function refers to the sum of various
areas for daily human activities. According to Wang [60], living function cover six aspects
based on the conduct of these daily human activities: living function, working function, leisure
function, consumption function, public service function, and social function. Furthermore,
the living subsystem often overlap with the production and ecological subsystems, as these are

areas designed to meet basic living needs, which cannot be easily reduced or transformed and
tends to restrict the development of the other subsystems. Generally, the ultimate goal of
urban development is to satisfy these basic needs to a high level, Livability, comfort, and convenience form the core aspects of living space. However, when the resident population experiences rapid growth alongside a shortage of public service resources, it results in resource
limitations, traffic congestion, and inadequate public services.
Consequently, addressing these challenges must take precedence in the coordinated
development of Changsha City. Ecological subsystem of Changsha City. The ecological
refers to the functional characteristics of the physical environment, in which it provides the
resources and inputs used for human activities such as organic matter and raw materials for
food and material production, and ecological services such as biodiversity, climate regulation
and mitigation, natural disaster protection, pest control and environmental purification, for
the overall human well-being [61]. Hence, the ecological environment is key to protecting

urban growth [62]. The ecological subsystem operates as an open system that is closely connected linked with the surrounding production and living subsystems, facilitating exchange of
materials within and between regions. For example, the industrial pollution produced from
the production function and the domestic garbage pollution by the living function will negatively impact ecological function. When the ecological function is compromised, healthy working and living environments is not conducive to the development of the city. To achieve an
optimum value of the ecological function, the ecological subsystem must have an appropriate
internal and external structure that is balanced with the living and ecological subsystems to
allow symbiotic interactions and meet the development needs of Changsha City [52].

Coupling and coordination quantitative analysis of the "production-livingecological" space system in Changsha City
According to the Changsha Statistical Yearbook, the total population of Changsha City in 2010
was 7,040,700, and the total GDP was 444,032 billion yuan; the per capita urban disposable
income in 2010 was 23,347 yuan; the per capita rural disposable income in 2010 was 10,640
yuan. The arable land area in 2010 was 276.79 thousand ha, and the built-up area was 27239
ha. This study measures the development changes of the production-living-ecological system
of Changsha City in the next 15 years based on the conditions from 2010–2019(Fig 6). Here,
employment in the primary industry, secondary industry, and tertiary industry were derived
from the total population, in which its corresponding output values were expected to reach
3,693.66 billion yuan in GDP in 2035.The GDP and living standard also gradually increased,
in which the total population was positively correlated with the total GDP. Meanwhile, the economic development will promote the increase of population, as more public service infrastructures are constructed, which maintains the residence of local population in the city and
increases the foreign population. Population growth also promotes the development of urban
production function, such as accelerated urbanization resulted in the encroachment of the
rural population into the urban areas, which would consequently increase the labor force and
lower the labor cost. Similarly, it also increased consumption, which revitalized economic production and consumption. This reflects the relationship between population development and
economic development. Here, gradual upward trends were observed. The expansion of builtup area is impacted by the rise of GDP. while gradually increases in the built-up areas were
also observed along with the development of production space. Built-up areas were predicted
to reach 70821.8 ha in 2035.Growth in built-up area as a result of economic progress and population growth However, because Changsha’s total area is limited, and ecological function
takes a portion of it, the built-up area reaches a plateau, and the rate of growth gradually slows.
As shown in Fig 6, the economic development particularly increased green spaces, which
improved environmental protection. On the one hand, people are more aware of environmental protection and have higher requirements for their living and working environment; on the
other hand, economic development brings more investment in environmental protection. The
reciprocal relationship between productive development and ecological protection is reflected
here. Future scenarios indicate that Changsha City will continue to comply with the management requirements of the "three zones and three lines", implementing appropriate arable land
protection measures. With this, slight changes in the arable land areas in Changsha City may
be observed. It was also observed that the overall development of Changsha City required the
preservation of ecological security and basic food security to have healthy and stable economic
development, in which the production, living, and ecological functions the intensity of human
activities must be maintained below the carrying capacity of the geographic environment.
Long-term urban planning projects will shape the urban environment for decades, not just a

single or two year cycles. Obtaining accurate urban growth projections is necessary to create a
scientific city plan. The above predictions for Changsha’s progress over the next 15 years may
provide urban planners, government agencies, and other stakeholders with a scientific basis.

Discussion
Contribution of system dynamics theory to the study of urban system
development
As a composite system, the "production-living-ecological" system of Changsha City was found
to have a significant causal cycle, in which the internal factors have interrelated influence on
each other, that may potentially form a beneficial or vicious cycle. The characteristic of the
cycle depends on the degree of coupling and coordination of the systems [63]. For example, in
the context of coupled production and living systems, Changsha’s population growth within a
reasonable range will bring labor force and consumption power to the economic development.
However, if population development exceeds the carrying capacity of Changsha’s resources, it
will lead to some social problems such as traffic congestion, housing tension, urban villages
and so on. Therefore, the development of Changsha City needs to be approached from a systemic point of view, from all aspects within the subsystems, to explore in depth the problems
encountered in its development. With the dynamic and open characteristic of Changsha City,
efficient communication with external resources is required to achieve efficient coupling of
resources within the system to derive its benefits and ensure synergy and sustainability
between the people and land [62]. With this, it provides new insights on urban planning
approaches that incorporates a systemic perspective and eliminates traditional methods to
urban planning.

System dynamics modelling for urban system collapse risk avoidance
While single analytical framework generally places the issue of "urban riskification" in a static
system of categorization, along with globalization and post-industrialization, different types of
urban risks have become intertwined, overlapping and compounding each other in a systemic
way [64]. The case study of Changsha City demonstrates that cities are coupled within the system and interacts altogether, suggesting that the primary, secondary and tertiary industries,
urban built-up area, and landscaped area are tightly linked. The entire system may be disrupted when one of these variables are overactive and uncontrolled. For instance, when
human activities exceed the carrying capacity of the physical environment such as when there
is uncontrolled population growth, the urban ecology is threatened, owing to the amount of
waste disposed in the environment. Further, an oversupply of labor and a shortage of labor
products also threatens the production function, which creates social problems, owing to
unemployment. When the ecological environment is damaged, the comfort of urban living
functions decreases, population out flows, and subsequently reduces labor force decreases consumption power. This, in turn, impacts the city’s productive functions, leading to urban
decline.

The generalizability of urban "production-life-ecology" prediction models
in the process of urban development
a) Scientific prediction of urban land use change can avoid the potential risk of urban expansion and other development modes to a certain extent [65]. The model in this paper aims to
provide a certain theoretical basis for assessing future urban land use risks.

b) The innovation of energy technology. The enhancement of production function can provide sufficient financial support for the innovation of energy technology, which is a kind of
mutual feedback mechanism. As the convenience and comfort of residents’ life increases and
the ecological environment improves, the city can attract high-quality talents and improve the
efficiency of energy technology innovation [66].
c)The guidance of the central government’s policy has a strong determining effect on the
change of the city’s "production-life-ecology" function, and it is necessary to weigh and consider all the factors when optimizing the city’s planning strategy using the model presented in
this paper. d) The central government’s policy essential to alter the city’s "production-life-ecology" function. The optimization of urban planning strategies using this model must be evaluated against the guidance of the central government’s policies and the specificity of the model
itself [67].
d)Reform and redesign of agricultural production methods, which is a significant aspect of
the city’s production function, is closely related to the innovation of energy technology, and
indicates the continuous improvement of the model. The reform and redesign of agricultural
production methods, which is closely related to the innovation of energy technology, indicates
the continuous improvement of the model. The reform and redesign of the production methods of agriculture. Similarly, agricultural production is an important aspect of the productive
function of the city, closely related to energy technology innovation, and indicative of the continuous improvement of the urban production-life-ecology model. The results of this study are
similar to the findings of the study of the "Literature of the City" [68–70].
Globally, regarding the "production-life-ecology" development of cities, substantial studies have focused on the efficient development and utilization of land functions, established a
comprehensive indicator system with 29 indicators and formulated a set of comprehensive
assessment methods [71]. In addition, regarding the development of urban "productionlife-ecology", previous studies revealed the importance of coordinating the promotion of
the integration of production and urbanization with carbon emission reduction for the construction of a green economic system and in-depth participation in global environmental
governance [72].

Limitations and prospects
Although Changsha City is comparatively more developed than other regions in central
China, a coupled and coordinated development within the city is insufficient. Rather, the focus
must be on urban development at a regional level. Secondly, the analysis model needs to be
further optimized by selecting a higher number of model variables and designing an improved
causal feedback path. Data accessibility was also limited, which affected data refinement. It is
recommended that more accurate and comprehensive data on urban production, living, and
ecology are incorporated. Moreover, the comprehensive and accurate data increases the generalizability and scientific validity of models. Furthermore, variable selection and indicators
must be more defined to establish a more systematic. System models at different scales with
subtle differences in variable selection. The system dynamics model emphasizes the coordination of subsystems and the synthesis of the larger system. At both township and city scales, the
coupling and coordination of internal subsystems are essential for the city system to operate
efficiently. However, there are differences in the internal subsystems and elements. For example, the township production function mainly refers to the agricultural, whereas cities focus on
the indirect production of products derived from the primary sector. A more representative
urban "human-land" relationship and situational simulation will be pursued in subsequent
studies. Additionally, exploring micro-levels such as cities and towns may yield refined results.

Conclusions
The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms and coupling coordination between
the "production-living-ecological" system of a city such as Changsha to determine the interaction among production, life, and ecological space subsystems. A qualitative analysis of the system dynamics was conducted to understand the characteristics and structure of the system,
while a system dynamics model of the production-living-ecology complex system was constructed using the Vensim PLE software to determine the internal structure of the complex
urban system. It was found that the overall trend of population, GDP, and built-up areas
showed an upward trend. A clear correlation among the three factors was also found, in which
mutual correlations among the "production-living-ecological" system had a significant influence on urban development and quality of life. Furthermore, this study showed that the system
dynamics model can be highly applicable in investigating the coordination of urban production, living, and ecological functions. In the system dynamics model, each variable is interconnected with each other, and none of them exists independently. Our findings conclude that the
production, living, and ecological functions of Changsha City are interacting with each other.
The model in this paper predicts the changes of Changsha City in the next fifteen years can
provide a scientific basis for the government policy makers and urban planners to plan the
development of the production-living-ecology functions in the future. It is recommended that
more accurate data are used to build a more representative model. This study provides a new
basis for decision makers in improving and ensuring sustainable urban development.

Abstract: The driving mechanism of expansion is the basis for policymaking in urban land management and control. In this study, Yangzhou city in China was used as an example. Based on the supply
and demand theory of land, a framework was constructed to analyze the driving factors behind
urban land expansion. Path analysis was used to determine the direct and indirect factors driving
urban land expansion. The results showed the following: (1) Urban land in Yangzhou city expanded
32,831.10 hm2 from 2005 to 2018, mainly in terms of farmland. This rapid expansion arose from the
contraction of rural residential areas, threatening ecological spaces such as water bodies. (2) Path
analysis indicated that fixed-asset investment, the added value of secondary and tertiary industries,
urban population, distance to the city center, and farmland area are the direct factors driving urban
land expansion. Land finance, technology input, and transportation ability indirectly influence urban
land by affecting other driving factors. (3) Increasing the level of urban land-use intensification,
properly adjusting economic development goals, reasonably controlling the population, exploring the
retention of construction land in city centers, and optimizing farmland and basic farmland plans need
to be considered in the management and control of urban land expansion. Furthermore, to guide the
orderly expansion of urban land, improving land management systems, promoting scientific and
technological progress, and scientifically designing transportation land are necessary strategies.

1. Introduction
Since the reform and opening-up of China, China has experienced large-scale urban
expansion, due to rapid industrialization and urbanization progress. In 1978, there were
only 193 cities and 2000 small towns in China. From 1978 to 2002, China implemented
the policy of transforming townships into towns and counties into cities. From 1992 to
2013, China experienced a boom in the construction of development zones and new urban
areas, along with the reshaping of counties and cities into districts. From 2002 to 2018,
metropolitan areas, urban agglomeration, and urban belts began to develop in clusters.
Within this process, the scale of urban land in China has expanded. The overall urban
pattern has been characterized by agglomeration [1]. In recent years, there has been a
phenomenon of local diffusion. The cities and towns around the metropolis, second-tier
cities, and cities in the central region are accelerating their development. The city is a
complex giant system. The process of urban expansion may result in the convergence of
various production factors, thus driving the overall development of the region. Urban land
is the facilitator of all social and economic activities in the urban system. Whether urban
land expands in an orderly way is related to the healthy development of urbanization.
China’s urban land use expanded from 11,608km2 in 1990 to 56,076 km2 in 2018, with an
average annual growth rate of 5.79%. This shows that Chinese cities are developing at an
unprecedented speed, and many local governments have used urban development as an
important assessment indicator [2]. The continuous expansion of urban land has laid the

Yangzhou has achieved rapid social and economic development since the implementation of the third revision of land utilization planning. The GDP has increased from
CNY 92.202 billion to CNY 669.643 billion, along with a rapid increase (40.92%) in urban
land expansion. This rapid urbanization poses a great threat to regional food safety and
ecological safety. Under the demands of the current national land space plan, the contradic-

tions among economic development, ecological protection, and other goals have become
increasingly severe. In this study, Yangzhou city in China was used as an example. Based
on the supply and demand theory of land, a framework was constructed to analyze the
driving factors behind urban land expansion. Path analysis was used to determine the
main factors that drive the expansion of urban land, while direct and indirect pathways
were analyzed to address the driving mechanism. This study could provide a reference for
the development of management and control policies in urban land expansion.
2. Framework Analyzing the Driving Factors of Urban Land Expansion Based on
Supply and Demand Theory
2.1. Theoretical Analysis of the Influence of the Supply–Demand Relationship on Urban Land Growth
Product price is determined by supply and demand, and the supply–demand relationship is the basis of the market mechanism [14]. In the market economy, as one of
the production factors, land goes into the market in the form of a “special product”, inevitably influenced by the supply–demand relationship. Its spatiotemporal configuration
must follow the inherent law of supply–demand theory [16,17]. Urban land expansion
is restricted by regional supply ability and influenced by social–economic development.
Urban land is the dynamic equilibrium in the interaction between land supply and actual
demand [5]. The natural supply and economic supply of land resources are the key factors
restricting the development and utilization of urban land. City development is a specific
use of urban land. Thus, the economic supply of urban land is based on the inelastic
natural supply, while being restricted by resource endowment, technology, location and
transportation, and land-use intensity [18,19]. Meanwhile, land resource configuration may
not spontaneously operate by following the market, urban land supply will be restricted
by the macro-regulations that are indicated by the government [20,21]. The government
holds the proprietorship of urban land and the development rights of collective land, and
the policy system directly determines the economic supply of urban land. With rapid
social–economic development, an increasing population, and economic development, there
is a need for more living and production space, leading to a continuous increase in the
demand for urban land. The limited supply of urban land and increasing urban land
demand determine the regional urban land expansion pattern through the regulation effect
of market mechanisms. In this study, we start from the land supply and demand perspecInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022,tive,

2.1.1. Supply Elements
(1) Natural endowment feature. The regional natural endowment feature determines
the natural supply of land, and further influences the flexibility of the economic supply of
land [22]. The best urban land is always located in the plain areas. The higher the elevation
and slope, the lower the land supply capability [23]. The topography of Yangzhou influ-

2.1.1. Supply Elements
(1) Natural endowment feature. The regional natural endowment feature determines
the natural supply of land, and further influences the flexibility of the economic supply
of land [22]. The best urban land is always located in the plain areas. The higher the
elevation and slope, the lower the land supply capability [23]. The topography of Yangzhou
influenced the urban land supply suitability due to its special features, displaying a fanshaped slope from west to east. Urban land expansion was mainly fulfilled by occupying
farmland, as farmland was the main supply source of urban land [24,25]. Thus, in this study,
slope, elevation, and farmland area were selected as indicators to evaluate the regional
endowment feature.
(2) Technology level. According to the Solow growth model, the technology level can
increase the marginal returns of work, thus decreasing the importance of land, having
a positive effect on capital investment in unit land, finally enhancing the economic supply of land resources [26]. Investment in technological upgrading, which represents the
technology level, was selected as an indicator to evaluate the regional technology level.
(3) Location. The distance to city center is the most important location factor influencing urban land expansion. A short distance to the city center leads to a stronger intensity of
social–economic activity, thus increasing the possibility of developing land for the city [27].
Developed transportation can significantly promote the acceptance of market influence
and decrease the transfer cost, which will increase the economic supply of land [28]. Thus,
the distances to city center and transportation accessibility were selected as indicators to
evaluate the location condition.
(4) Land-use intensity. Based on the Harrod–Domar model [29], the land-use intensity
level reflects the substitution relationship between land and capital. If the other parameters
are fixed, only the contribution of land and capital to the economy is considered, capital could stimulate the economy, and land and capital could be replaced by technology.
Thus, average fixed-asset investment was selected as an indicator to evaluate land-use
intensity [30].
(5) Policy system. The local government is the administrator of the land market, as
well as the oligopolist in the primary land market [31]. This double identity resulted in
the local government generally increasing its financial income through land leasing. In
the 1990s, China implemented tax sharing system reform and established a tax sharing
budget management system. In China, on the basis of a reasonable division of the scope
of powers of governments at all levels, the budget revenues of governments at all levels
were mainly divided according to taxes. The budgets of governments at all levels were
relatively independent and had a clear responsibility for balancing. The financial difference
between governments at all levels was adjusted through the transfer payment system
from the central government to the local government, or from the local government at the
next higher level to the local government at the next lower level. The tax sharing budget
management system clarified the division of central and local fiscal expenditure, central
and local fiscal revenue, and the intergovernmental fiscal transfer payment system. After
tax reform, the government try to maximize disposable income. In order to relieve local
financial stress, local governments try to facilitate the “land to money, money to land” circle
through land condemnation and transfer. Land finance has become an important way to
increase local financial income and local government achievements [32]. However, there
are differences in the land regulation policies and supervision efforts of local governments
in different regions, resulting in differing dependence on “land finance”. Therefore, there
are differences in behavior choices in urban land supply. Different behavior will be selected
in urban land supply due to the difference in the dependency on land finance [33]. The
income comes from land transfer is the main source of land financial benefit [34]. Thus,
land transfer income was selected as indicator to evaluate the policy system that local
governments adopted for urban land expansion.

2.1.2. Demand Elements
(1) Population increase. Population growth leads to an increase in consumption demand, which is the fundamental factor affecting land demand [35,36]. Urban population
growth results in pressure to increase the existing land-use space. Therefore, more production and living spaces need to be added to meet the needs of population growth, which
leads to a rapid expansion of the urban construction land scale [37]. Thus, the urban
population increase amount was selected as indicator to evaluate population increase.
(2) Economic development. Regional economic development needs investment in a
production element. The demand for urban land is influenced by economic development
because urban land is the main resource for urban construction and industrial development.
The characteristic of total economic development influences the demand for urban land,
further driving area change [38]. Urban land is the main resource of the secondary and
tertiary industries. Thus, the added value of the secondary and tertiary industries was
selected as indicator to evaluate the economic development level.
2.2. Path Analysis on the Influence Mechanism of Urban Land Expansion
Path analysis is one type of multivariate statistical analysis technology used to study
the interaction between explanatory variables, as well as the influence of explanatory
variables on explained variables [39]. Direct path is used to address the direct effect of
one specific explanatory variable on an explained variable, while indirect path is used
to address the indirect effect of other explanatory variables on explained variables [40].
Assuming that independent variable y was influenced by multiple factors x1 ,x2 , . . . ,xm ,
and each factor was linearly correlated with y, we can construct the following multiple
regression equation:
y = b0 + b1 x1 + b2 x2 + . . . + bm xm
(1)
where, if we divide the correlation coefficient riy between dependent variables xi (i = 1,2,
. . . ,m) and independent variable y into the direct effect of xi to y (direct path coefficient),
and the indirect effect of xi to y that acts through other dependent variables (indirect path
coefficient), the relative importance of each variable could be directly compared.
The normal equation of path coefficient p01 . . . p0m could be drawn as below:





p1y + r12 p2y + . . . r1m pmy = r1y
r21 p1y + p2y + . . . r2m pmy = r2y

where rij is the correlation coefficient of xi to x j ; riy denotes the correlation coefficient of xi
to y, i.e., the integrated influence of xi on y; piy represents direct path coefficient, i.e., the
normalized partial correlation coefficient of xi to y, which shows the direct effect of xi on y.
qij = rij piy

(3)

qiy = ∑ rij piy

(4)

i6= j

In Equation (3), qij is the direct path coefficient between paired variables, indicating
the indirect effect of xi on y acting through x j . In Equation (4), qiy is the indirect path
coefficient, showing the total indirect effect of xi on y acting through all other explanatory
variables.

4.2.1. Recognition of Direct Factors
The direct driving factors of urban land expansion were sorted according to the direct
path coefficient, from high to low. The order was: x5 , x8 , x7 , x3 , x1 , x6 , x2 , and x4 , of which,
the direct path coefficients of x5 , x8 , x7 , x3 , and x1 were higher than their indirect path
coefficients, thus they were defined as direct factors (Table 3, Figure 4).
4.2.2. Recognition of Indirect Factors
The indirect driving factors of urban land expansion were sorted according to the
indirect path coefficient, from high to low. The order was: x6 , x2 , x8 , x7 , x3 , x4 , x1 , and x5 ,
of which, the indirect path coefficients of x6 , x2 , and x4 were higher than their direct path
coefficients, influencing urban land expansion through other driving factors, thus they
were defined as direct factors (Table 3, Figure 4).
5. Discussion
5.1. Urban Land Expansion Scale
In the agricultural land, farmland was the main source of urban land expansion,
accounting for 40.55%. In the construction land, rural residential land was the main
source, accounting for 40.40%. This may be due to the implementation of rural residential
management policies, such as “Million hectares of fertile farmland” and “Link the increase
and decrease of urban-rural construction land”, which enabled the spatial displacement
and development rights to transform between urban and rural construction lands. In the
unused land, water areas were the main source of urban land, accounting for 6.01%. In
summary, farmland was the main source of urban land expansion, while the decrease in
residential land in rural areas was another important source supporting the rapid increase
in urban land. Apart from this, water space was occupied by urban land expansion,
accounting for 6.45% of the total expansion area. However, ecological spaces, such as water
areas, were threatened in the urban land expansion process (Table 2).
5.2. Path Analysis of Urban Land Expansion
5.2.1. Recognition of Direct Factors
The direct path coefficient of x5 was −0.32, directly inhibiting urban land expansion.
It was indicated that urban land expansion could be effectively inhibited through landuse intensity enhancement and using capital to replace land investment. The direct path
coefficient of x8 was 0.30, directly promoting urban land expansion. The secondary and
tertiary industries developed rapidly due to the new economic development strategy,
which was based on an advanced manufacturing and service industry. Finally, this led to a
rapid increase in urban land expansion demand. The direct path coefficient of the urban
population (x7 ) was 0.28. As the urban population increased, the urban land demands for
residence, industry, and entertainment increased rapidly, leading to continuously increased
urban land [20]. The direct path coefficient of x3 was −0.22. This indicated that the city
center was the important urban land expansion source. The shorter the distance to city
center, the higher the possibility that the land will transfer to urban land. The direct path
coefficient of x1 was −0.18, directly inhibiting urban land expansion. This may be due to
the strict farmland protection policy, which restricted the transformation of farmland to
urban land. Another possible reason may be the long distance from the intensive farmland
area to the city center, as the low urban population in those areas indirectly inhibits urban
land expansion (Table 3).
5.2.2. Recognition of Indirect Factors
The direct path coefficient of x6 (−0.12) was smaller than the indirect path coefficient
(0.41), defined as an indirect factor indirectly promoting urban land expansion (Figure 5a).
The indirect influence was acting through x8 , x7 , and x3 . The indirect path coefficients
between each paired variable were 0.11, 0.08, and 0.07, respectively. Expanding urban land
areas by transferring collective land into state-owned land, and by recycling full due land,

illegal land, and unused land were the two main ways the government obtained benefits
from land transfer. The local government preferred to use the first method because it was
easy to implement, and could maximize the benefit of land transfer [41]. This resulted
in rapid urban land expansion. The region has a large population, a good location, and
a developed economy, which was attractive to investors. Meanwhile, the government

on this region as a means to obtain greater financial income. This indicates that the
local government directly and indirectly promoted urban land expansion as they pursued
land finance and administrative achievement (Figure 5).

influence urban land expansion. Based on these results, we propose the following suggestions. In order to slow down the speed of urban land expansion, improving land-use intensification and promoting the three-dimensional development of urban land could be
considered. Moderately adjusting the economic development goals, maintaining an ap-

growth is one of the driving forces of urban land expansion. Meanwhile, the region
with advanced technology was followed by developed industry, highly intensive but still
attracting a large amount of labor, thus promoting urban land expansion (Figure 5).
The indirect path coefficient of transportation accessibility (−0.10) was larger than the
direct path coefficient (−0.07), indirectly inhibiting urban land expansion (Figure 5c). The
indirect influence acted through x1 , x6 , and x7 . The indirect path coefficients between each
paired variable were −0.06, −0.06, and 0.05, respectively. The urban land expansion area
was concentrated near the city center and the central town beside the highway. Many new
roads had been constructed outside the city center and the central town in the previous
years, thus the transportation accessibility was greatly improved. The large farmland area
and low land financial income inhibited urban land expansion in those regions. Meanwhile,
improved transportation accessibility in the outer suburban districts promoted population
movement, which was beneficial for increasing the population, indirectly promoting urban
land expansion. However, considering multiple factors, transportation accessibility poses
an indirect inhibitory effect on urban land expansion (Figure 5).
5.3. Policy Suggestions
(1) Average fixed-asset investment, the added value of secondary and tertiary industries, urban population, distance to the city center, and farmland area are important direct
factors that drive urban land expansion. The integrated and direct effect of the first four
factors plays a more important role. Indirect factors often act through them to indirectly
influence urban land expansion. Based on these results, we propose the following suggestions. In order to slow down the speed of urban land expansion, improving land-use
intensification and promoting the three-dimensional development of urban land could
be considered. Moderately adjusting the economic development goals, maintaining an
appropriate economic development speed, optimizing the industrial structure, and promoting the development of a modern service industry could decrease the dependency of
economic development on urban land. The demand for urban land could be reduced by
controlling the population. Considering the location factor could help in exploring the
retention of construction land in the city center. Combining the “Million hectares of fertile
farmland” and “Link the increase and decrease of urban-rural construction land” policies,
optimizing the farmland and basic farmland design, and assigning part of the farmland to
urban development could control urban land expansion through ecological isolation.
(2) Land finance scale, technology investment, and transportation accessibility directly
affect urban land expansion, as well as indirectly influencing urban land expansion through
other factors. However, the indirect effects have an obvious lagging effect. To break the
government monopoly on land supply, land management policy should be improved. Several
strategies could be attempted: (1) Improve the method of land condemnation by restricting
local government land transfers and initiate the reuse of urban land storage in the regions that
have a better location and economy, and a larger population. (2) Accelerate financial system
reform to adjust land transfer policies. (3) Find an effective way to overcome the difficulties
with land finance. Construct a complete local tax system by reasonably levying municipal
governments to guarantee a steady increase in local income. Meanwhile, to reduce the demand
for urban land, industry structures should be updated through technology processing. To
achieve this target, the following strategies could be tried: (1) continue to improve the level
of regional technology and reasonably allocate land for high-tech industries; and (2) move
some high-tech industries to city centers, and reduce the urban land supply stress in city
centers. Finally, transportation land should be designed in scientific way to avoid repeated
construction. The total amount of transportation land should be controlled to accomplish
orderly urban land expansion.
6. Conclusions
The total urban land expansion area was 32,929.60 hm2 in Yangzhou from 2005 to
2018. The newly increased urban land was mainly located in the city center and in the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 15821

12 of 14

rural areas of Jiangdu district, Yizheng, Gaoyou, and Baoying. The expansion in urban
land was dominated by farmland, which accounted for 40.55% of the total expansion
area. Meanwhile, a decrease in residential land in rural areas was another important
source of land for urban land expansion, accounting for 40.40% of the total expansion area.
Furthermore, water spaces were occupied in urban land expansion, accounting for 6.01%
of the total expansion area.
The driving factors of urban land expansion were sorted according to their contribution, from high to low. The order was as follows: added value of secondary and tertiary
industries, urban population, technology investment, distance to city center, average fixedasset investment, land finance scale, transportation accessibility, and farmland area. Of
these, average fixed-asset investment, added value of secondary and tertiary industries,
urban population, distance to city center, and farmland area were the direct factors. Land
finance scale, technology investment, and transportation accessibility were the indirect
factors, which indirectly influenced urban land expansion through other driving factors.
Land finance scale promoted urban land expansion through the added value of secondary
and tertiary industries, urban population, and distance to the city center. Technology
investment assisted urban land expansion through the added value of secondary and
tertiary industries, average fixed-asset investment, and urban population. Transportation
accessibility inhibited urban land expansion through farmland area, land finance scale, and
urban population.
Direct and indirect driving factors should be considered in the management and
control of urban land expansion policymaking. From a direct factor perspective, increasing
the level of urban land-use intensification, properly adjusting economic development goals,
reasonably controlling the population, tapping into the power of the retention of construction land in city centers, and optimizing farmland and basic farmland planning need to be
considered in the management and control of urban land expansion. Moreover, from an
indirect factor viewpoint, to guide the orderly expansion of urban land, improving land
management systems, promoting scientific and technological progress, and scientifically
designing transportation land are necessary strategies.

We developed a spatially explicit method to examine the effects of urbanisation on ecosystem
service values. Especially, a spatially explicit urban growth model was developed through
incorporating a macro-scale model (system dynamics) and a micro-scale model (CLUE-S). In
addition, spatially explicit ecosystem service values were simulated under three socio-economic
scenarios: (1) current economic growth, (2) rapid economic growth, and (3) sustainable
economic growth. Analysis of results suggests that the degradation of ecosystem functions is
associated with the conversion from water body and farmland to built-up and barren lands.
Moreover, obvious spatial variations were found associated with ecosystem service values.
Keywords: spatially explicit method; urban growth modeling; ecosystem service valuation

1. Introduction
Numerous urban growth models have been
developed to predict the extent and locations
of urban development (Jiang & Yao 2010).
These models can be divided into two general
groups: aspatial models and spatially explicit
models. Aspatial models have been developed
to predict the amount of urban developments
in aggregated geographical areas (Seto &
Kaufmann 2003; Irwin & Geoghegan 2001).
One of the earliest aspatial models applies the
bid-rent theory to explain new residential
locations (Alonso 1960, 1964; Herbert &
Stevens 1960). In the model, land use and land
cover change (LUCC) is considered to be
driven by accessibility to markets. Later, many
sophisticated econometric models were developed and applied to examine the drivers of
urbanisation in different cities (Chomitz &

Gray 1996; Guldmann & Wang 1998; Huang
et al. 2009; Landis & Zhang 1998). As an
example, system dynamics (SD) models
proposed by Forrester (1961, 1969) have
been applied to examine causal factors of
urbanisation, and simulate future urban growth
in aggregated spatial units (Han et al. 2009;
Leal Neto et al. 2006; Yu et al. 2011).
Although aspatial models have been widely
applied, critics of these models have emerged,
and the specific locations of LUCCs have been
predicted using spatially explicit models.
These models include cellular automata
(Clarke et al. 1997; Kamusoko et al. 2009;
Li & Yeh 2002; Zhang et al. 2011), agentbased models (Evans & Kelley 2004; Mena
et al. 2011; Parker et al. 2003), and the
conversion of land use and its effects (CLUE)
(Verburg et al. 2002, 2006).

Parallel to the research of urban growth
modelling, ecologists have attempted to
identify the functions, including goods and
services, provided by natural ecological
systems and quantify the monetary value of
these functions since the 1970s (Holdren &
Ehrlich 1974; Odum 1977; Westman 1977). In
particular, a pioneering study conducted by
Costanza et al. (1997) divided the world’s
ecosystems into 16 biomes, each of which can
provide 17 types of services (e.g. gas
regulation, climate regulation, water supply,
soil formation and retention). Further, Costanza et al. (1997) estimated the average
world’s ecosystem service value to be
approximately US$33 trillion per year (based
on 1994 US$) using a market valuation
method. Since then, many scholars have
applied the Costanza et al. (1997) valuation
method to examine the value of ecosystem
services for farmland, forest, grassland, and
wetland ecosystems (Hu et al. 2008, Li et al.
2007, 2010; Tong et al. 2007; Zang et al. 2011;
Zhao et al. 2004). However, according to the
survey results from more than 200 Chinese
ecologists, some ecosystem services have been
found to be overestimated or underestimated
when applied to Chinese cities (Xie et al.
2001). Xie et al. (2001, 2010) argued that, with
Costanza et al. (1997)’s method, ecological
services provided by farmland were insufficiently valued, while services provided by
other biomes, such as wetlands and forest,
were overvalued. In order to address this
problem, Xie et al. (2001) proposed a “unit
value”-based method to localise the parameters for ecosystem assessment in China,
and it has been widely employed to examine
the influences of urbanisation on the service
value of surrounding ecosystems in China
(Zhao et al. 2009).
Until now, most studies have emphasised
examination of the impacts of urbanisation on
ecosystem service values for an aggregated
geographic area (e.g. a city or county), and
ignored the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem
services (Zhang et al. 2010). Spatial hetero-

geneity, however, may be important as it may
influence the process and pattern of an
ecosystem significantly (Pickett et al. 1997).
Therefore, examining the detailed spatial
variations of ecosystem service values and
their changes over time is essential. To address
this problem, this study developed a spatially
explicit method through integrating an urban
growth model and an ecosystem valuation
approach. With this approach, the spatial
heterogeneity of the ecosystem value changes
has been examined. The reminder of this paper
is organised as follows. The next section
introduces the study area and data. Section 3
reports the methodology employed in this
study, including the spatially explicit urban
growth model and ecosystem service valuation
approach. The results of this research are
reported in Section 4, and finally the paper
concludes with Section 5.
2. Study area and data
Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, China,
has been selected as the study area. Daqing
covers approximately 5144 square kilometers
and lies between latitudes 458460 and 468550
north and longitudes 1248190 and 1258120 east
(Figure 1). It is located in the continental
monsoon climate region, and the annual
temperature and precipitation are 5.68C and
427.5 mm respectively. Daqing City consists
of five districts: Saertu, Ranghulu, Longfeng,
Datong, and Honggang. The population of
Daqing was 1.25 million in 2005, which
accounts for approximately 3.3% of the overall
population in the Heilongjiang Province. The
gross domestic product (GDP) was about US
$17.7 billion in 2005, or 16% of the GDP of
the Heilongjiang Province. Daqing has one of
the largest oil production fields in the world,
with an annual oil production over 1 billion
tons. In particular, 60% of the GDP of Daqing
can be attributed to the petroleum industry.
The development of the petroleum industry
has led to the rapid growth of GDP and
population, and as a result an increasing area

of land has been converted from natural land to
residential, industrial, and commercial land
uses. Unlike natural lands, urban lands have
profound and adverse effects on natural
ecological systems, although they may also
provide convenience and economic benefits to
local residents. As an example, urbanisation
leads to the urban heat island effect, reduced
biodiversity, increased amounts of brownfields, as well as air and water pollution, all of
which deteriorate the quality of life of local
residents. Because of the lack of strategic
planning, Daqing is facing many of the
aforementioned challenging environmental
problems, and it is essential to explore the
effects of future urban development on the
surrounding natural ecosystems.
For this study, we obtained Landsat
thematic mapper (TM) imagery from 1990,
2000, and 2005 to derive historical land use
maps of Daqing. These Landsat TM images,
with six spectral bands (bands 1 – 5 and 7) and
30 m spatial resolution, were collected from the
China Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station
and Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural
Science. In addition, digital elevation data were
obtained from the global topography database
with a spatial resolution of 3 arc-seconds

(90 m). Soil maps were obtained from the
Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of
Sciences. Transportation networks, including
railways, provincial roads, and rural roads,
were provided by the Surveying and Mapping
Department, Heilongjiang Province. In order to
validate all the collected data, including remote
sensing imagery and GIS data, a topographic
map with a scale of 1:5 was employed as the
reference data. Finally, socio-economic data,
including population information, GDP, etc.,
were obtained from the Daqing Statistics
Yearbooks of 1991, 2001, and 2006.
With the Landsat TM imagery, land use
maps of 1990, 2000, and 2005 were generated
using a guided clustering method developed by
Reese et al. (2002). This is a hybrid
supervised/unsupervised classification technique which is proven to generate highaccuracy LUCC products. In this study, the
adoption of this method is due to its
convenience and high accuracy. Six land use
types were identified: farmland, forest, grassland, water bodies (wetlands, lakes, rivers,
reservoirs, ponds, etc.), built-up (residential,
transportation, industrial including petroleum
field), and barren land (alkaline and salinised
land, sand, etc.). To ensure satisfactory

278

classification accuracy, a post-classification
review was conducted through manual
interpretation and digitisation, with the topographic map and other historical maps as
references. The overall classification accuracy
was checked using 600 ground control points
chosen with a stratified random sampling
technique, and the accuracy for each land use
map is higher than 85%.

Methodology

3.1 Spatially explicit urbanisation
modelling
To simulate the urban growth of Daqing City
under a number of socio-economic scenarios,
we integrated the SD model and the CLUE-S
model to develop future urban land use change
scenarios. SD was initially developed by
Forrester (1961, 1969), and subsequently
applied in tourism management, watershed
management, and land use change analysis
(Georgantzas 2003; He et al. 2006; Leal Neto
et al. 2006; Yu et al. 2010). SD is an effective
means to examine the behaviours of a complex
spatio-temporal system. It is effective in

handling the feedback loops from both inside
and outside the system and examining the
impact of time lag on the behaviours of the
system. The complex relationships among
factors can be constructed as feedback loops,
stocks, and flows. SD can reflect the structure,
function and dynamic interactions among
behaviours of a complex system. Therefore,
it provides a useful tool for analysing the
relationships between land use change and its
driving forces. The driving forces of LUCC
can be divided into three groups: natural
factors, land use policy, and socio-economic
factors (Nunes & Auge 1996; Turner et al.
1995; Vellinge 1998). As few variations are
associated with natural factors (e.g. climate
and topography) in Daqing, only land use
policy and socio-economic factors have been
considered in this study. Land use policies
include zoning, the reclamation of barren land,
and the returning of farmland to forest and
grassland; and socio-economic factors include
GDP, population, and technology (e.g. agricultural and forest production technology)
progress at different levels. The SD model (see
Figure 2) was constructed and calibrated using

the Vensim PLE 5.10, commercial software
developed by Ventana Systems, Inc. (http://
www.vensim.com/).
With the projected future urban growth
demand at aggregated levels, the spatial
module of the CLUE-S model developed by
Verburg and his colleagues (Verburg et al.
2002; Verburg & Veldkamp 2004; Verburg &
Overmars 2009) was applied to predict the
urban development at specific locations.
Especially, land use demands derived from
the SD model have been translated into land
use changes at different locations within the
study area (Verburg et al. 2002). Nine
variables, elevation, slope, soil type, distance
to rivers and ponds, distance to railway,
distance to provincial roads, distance to rural
roads, distance to the nearest town, and
distance to county boundary, were selected as
driving factors to assess the likelihood of a cell
being devoted to a particular land use category.
In particular, the probability of a cell
belonging to a particular land use type was
calculated using a logistic regression model,
detailed as follows.


Pi

ð1Þ

Where Pi represents the probability of a grid
cell being assigned to a land use category i, Xj,i
represents the jth driving factors of land use
category i, and n is the total number of driving
factors. The relationship between land use
probabilities and driving factors is shown in
Table 1. The relative operating characteristic
(ROC) value was utilised in this study to
evaluate whether the model can explain all
land use types with satisfactory accuracy
(Pontius & Schneider 2001). ROC is a
quantitative measure that examines the goodness-of-fit between the simulated land use map
and the reference map through calculating a
statistical summary of a series of 2 by 2
contingency tables derived from a number of

279

simulated results. The ROC values for these
models were higher than 0.65, indicating the
spatial distribution of all land use types can be
well explained by the selected nine driving
factors. Especially for forest, water body, and
built-up land use categories, better ROC values
(. 0.8) were achieved.
After examining the driving factors using
the logistic regression model, we also obtained
the land use change elasticity (ELAS), which
was calculated based on the conversion rates
among land use types during the period 1990
to 2000 (see Table 2). The ELAS for each land
use type ranges from 0 to 1, representing the
difficulty of converting a land use type to other
types. The higher the ELAS value, the more
difficult is the conversion to other land use
types. An ELAS value of 0.5 or under (e.g.
farmland and water body) indicates that a land
use type is more likely to be converted to other
types (see Table 2). Otherwise, an ELAS value
between 0.5 and 0.8 (e.g. grassland and barren
land) indicates it is difficult to convert to other
land use types. Furthermore, with a higher
ELAS value (e.g. between 0.8 and 1 for
forestland and urban land), a land use type is
much more difficult to convert to other types
(see Table 2). After estimating the logistic
regression coefficients and the ELAS value for
each land use type (Verburg et al. 2006), we
applied the CLUE-S model to iteratively
allocate the land use changes using probability
maps and the ELAS values. The allocated area
for each land use type was compared to the
land use demand estimated by the SD model,
and adjusted repeatedly until the allocated area
was equal to the requirements for all land use
types.
With the integrated SD and CLUE-S
model, we simulated the urban growths of
Daqing City under three socio-economic and
land use scenarios: (1) current economic
growth, (2) rapid economic growth, and (3)
sustainable economic growth. With the current
economic growth, the population growth rate
was assumed to be approximately 0.9%, the
GDP was set to grow about 7.2% annually, and

the technology progress was assumed to keep
the present pace (1.2%). These numbers were
utilised according to multiple reports from
Chinese governments (State Council Information Office of China 2000; The Fifth
Communist Party of China Central Committee
2002). With current population growth, GDP
growth, and technology progress rates, their
respective values under rapid and sustainable
economic growth scenarios were determined
according to relevant projected national and
local socio-economic data from 2005 to 2015
(State Council Information Office of China
2000). In particular, under the rapid economic
development scenario, population growth rate
was set to be 1.1%, GDP growth rate was
assigned to be 7.5% per year, and technology
progress rate was set to be 1.5%. Under the
sustainable economic growth scenario, population growth rate was set to be 0.7%, GDP
growth rate was assumed to be 7%, and
technology progress rate was set to a lower
level (1%).

3.2 Spatially explicit ecosystem service
valuation
In order to evaluate the impact of urbanisation
on surrounding ecosystems in Daqing, China,
we quantified the ecosystem service values for
each biome using the valuation coefficients
provided by Xie et al. (2008). In particular, the
ecosystem service values were generated using
the following steps. First, nine ecosystem
service functions, food production, raw
materials production, gas regulation, climate
regulation, hydrological regulation, waste
treatment, soil formation and conservation,
biodiversity maintenance, and providing aesthetic values, were identified following Cost-

anza’s classification scheme. Second, as each
biome provides 17 types of service, the
ecosystem service value of food production,
one of these services, is determined as
approximately 1/17 of the total values. Therefore, the unit service value for food production
of farmland was assigned to be 1/17 of the
agricultural production market price. In this
research, the per hectare farmland service
value was set to be US$131, which was
calculated using the price data for major crops
in 2005. Further, the ratios between the service
values of other ecosystem functions and the
food production service value of per unit
farmland were estimated through a questionnaire survey approach (see Table 3). In this
study, due to the difficulty of having a perfect
match, the river/lake and wetland were
grouped into one class (water body), and
desert was considered to be equivalent to
barren land. With the food production service
value of per unit farmland and the corresponding ratios, the service values of other
ecosystem functions were derived (see Table
4). Consequently, the ecosystem service per
unit value for each land use category was
generated as the summation of each ecosystem
service function value (see Table 4). Finally,
the overall value of ecosystem services in
Daqing was estimated using the following
equation.
ESV ¼

n
X

ðAk £ VCk Þ

ð2Þ

k¼1

Where ESV is the estimated ecosystem service
value, Ak is the area (ha) for land use category
k, VCk is the value coefficient (US$/ha/year)
for land use category k and n is the overall
number of land use categories.

In order to better examine the estimated
error of VC values, a sensitivity analysis was
applied to examine the dependence of
ecosystem service values on the employed
valuation coefficients. The coefficient of
sensitivity (CS) was applied to evaluate the
elasticity of ESV, and can be calculated as
follows (Kreuter et al. 2001; Wang et al.
2006).
CSk ¼

ðESVj 2 ESVi Þ=ESVi
ðVCjk 2 VCik Þ=ðVCik Þ

ð3Þ

Where CSk is the coefficient of sensitivity for a
land use type k, ESV is the ecosystem service
value, VC is the value coefficient, ‘i’
represents the initial stage, and ‘j’ represents
the adjusted stage. The coefficient of sensi-

tivity indicates the sensitivity of the total ESV
to the change of the ecological system
valuation coefficient for a specific land use
category. The greater the coefficient of
sensitivity, the more critical is an accurate
ecosystem VC for a specific land use type.

Results

4.1

Urban growth modelling

The SD model was constructed using the
1990– 2000 land use data, and validated with
the 2001– 2005 data. Validation results (see
Table 5) indicate that the SD model performed
reasonably well, as the relative error of the
simulated land use demand is less than 10%
when compared to the reference land use area
for the same year (2005). Therefore, the

developed SD model has adequate accuracy,
and can be employed to simulate future land
use demands.
After calibration and validation, the developed SD model was applied to simulate land
use demands for the next 10-year period
(2006 – 2015). The simulated scenarios of land
use demands for 2015 and associated changes
are shown in Table 6. Results indicate, from
2005 to 2015, human-dominated land uses
such as built-up land and barren land have
increased rapidly together with the significant
decrease of water body and farmland. Moreover, land use changes vary significantly under
different socio-economic and land use scenarios. For example, built-up land is projected
to increase from 32,380 ha in 2005 to 44,707.6
ha in 2015 under the current economic growth,
to 47,070 ha under rapid economic growth or
to 43,040 ha under sustainable economic
growth, with an overall increment of 38.07%,
45.37%, or 32.92% respectively. With the
incoming depletion of oil resources, Daqing is
facing the challenge of transforming from an
Table 6.

283

oil-resource-based city to a city with a
diversified economy. Associated with high
demand for built-up land for economic development, a high speed of urban expansion will
occur in the following years. Meanwhile, as
high-speed economic development is at the cost
of land resources and natural environments,
barren land is projected to increase 15,979 ha
with the current economic growth, 31,959 ha
with rapid economic development growth or
12,453 ha with sustainable economic growth,
an increment of 21.03%, 42.06%, or 16.39%
respectively. In addition, the water body will
decrease significantly from 2005 to 2015.
During this period, its area decreases from
55,628 ha to 29,446 ha under current economic
growth, to 19,309 ha under rapid economic
growth, or to 38,504 ha under sustainable
economic development, with a total decrement
of 47.07% (4.71% annually), 65.29% (6.53%
annually), or 30.78% (3.08% annually) respectively due to a great amount of water
consumption. The decrease of the water body
will be mainly due to the large amount of water

consumption during the process of oil extraction and production, in addition to residential,
commercial, and other industrial usages. Due to
the policy of returning farmland to forest and
grassland, forest and grassland will increase
noticeably, and the total increment of forest will
be 55.71% with the current economic growth,
24.50% with rapid economic growth, or
74.45% with sustainable growth. In summary,
as a result of economic development, humandominated land will increase noticeably at the
cost of water body.
With the knowledge of aggregated LUCC
in Daqing, it is necessary to examine the
specific locations of the changes. Through
applying the land use data from 1990 to 2000,
the CLUE-S model was developed to distribute the aggregated land use demands
predicted by the SD model to specific spatial

locations. The Kappa value was employed to
assess the modeling accuracy (Cohen 1960). It
is an important index that measures the
association between the simulated and the
reference images. Kappa ranges from 2 1 to 1,
and a value of 1 indicates a perfect agreement.
In this study, the Kappa value is 0.82,
indicating that the CLUE-S model has
generated satisfactory results for simulating
the spatial distribution of future land use
demands. Then, this CLUE-S model was
applied to simulate the LUCC for the period
from 2006 to 2015. Several conclusions can be
obtained through visualising the spatial
changes of land use types from 2005 to 2015
(see Figure 3). First, it is projected that
significant land use changes will take place
during these 10 years, and due to rapid
urbanisation many hectares of farmland will be

converted to built-up lands, in particular in the
northeastern part of Daqing (from A1 to A2,
A3, or A4). Further, due to the increasing
demand for food, some forest will be
converted to farmland, and some forest and
grassland will be transformed to barren land
because of environment degradation. An
example of this trend can be clearly identified
in the southwest of Daqing (from B1 to B2, B3,
or B4). Associated with these patterns, the
shrinking of water bodies (from C1 to C2, C3,
or C4) and farmland (from D1 to D2, D3, or
D4), and the expansions of barren lands are
clearly shown in the southern part of Daqing.
4.2 Ecosystem service value change
analysis
With the results of land use changes, the
ecosystem service valuation method developed by Xie et al. (2008) was applied to
examine the impact of land use change on
surrounding natural ecosystems in Daqing
during the period 2005 to 2015 (Table 7). As
can be discerned from Table 7, the total
ecosystem service value in Daqing was about
$761.16 million in 2005, and this value is
projected to decrease to $595.94 million under
current economic growth, $518.92 million
under rapid economic growth, or $654.58
million under sustainable economic growth in
Table 7.

285

2015, with a total reduction of 21.71%,
31.83%, or 14% (2.17%, 3.18%, and 1.40%
annually). This is mainly due to the significant
decrease of water body, as the total ecosystem
service value of water body will decrease from
$365.31 million to $193.37 million (under
current economic growth), $126.80 million
(under rapid economic growth), or $252.86
million (under sustainable economic growth),
or 47.07%, 65.29%, or 30.78% (4.71%, 6.53%,
or 3.08% annually) respectively. In addition,
the ecosystem service value of farm land will
decrease slightly from 2005 to 2015 (see Table
7). Conversely, the ecosystem service values
provided by forest and grassland are projected
to increase from 2005 to 2015. In particular,
the ecosystem service values provided by
forest will increase 55.71% (5.57% annually)
under current economic growth, 24.47%
(2.45% annually) under rapid economic
growth, or 74.40% (7.44% annually) under
sustainable economic growth respectively.
And the ecosystem service values provided
by barren land will increase 21.09% (2.11%
annually) under current economic growth,
42.11% (4.21% annually) under rapid economic growth, or 16.44% (1.64% annually)
under sustainable economic growth respectively. Similarly, the ecological service value
provided by grassland will also increase

slightly. These increments, however, cannot
offset the loss of ecological service values due
to the diminishment of water body.
With the knowledge of overall ecosystem
service value change in Daqing, we further
examined the specific locations with noticeable changes. Through applying the ecosystem
service value coefficients to the land use
change map generated from the integrated SD
and CLUE-S model, we derived the ESV maps
of 2005 and 2015, and illustrated the spatial
and temporal dynamic changes of ESV (see
Figure 3). Several impressions can be obtained
from Figure 3. First, around the original city
boundary, ESV is projected to decrease
significantly due to rapid urbanisation. In
these areas, a large number of natural lands,
particularly water body, will be transformed
into built-up land, and the ESV will decrease
sharply, as can be seen from the district A (A1
to A2, A3, or A4) in Figure 3. Second, in the
northwestern part of Daqing City, the ESV
decreases slightly due to the conversion from
forest and grassland to farmland and barren
lands (see district B). This can be explained by
the increasing need for farmland for food
production. Finally, in the southern part of
Daqing, there is an apparent and significant
decrement of ESV due to the shrinking of
water body and expansion of barren lands (see
districts C and D).

Discussion and conclusions

In this study, we developed a spatially explicit
method to examine the effects of urbanisation
on ecosystem service values by integrating
urban growth modelling and ecosystem service
valuation methods, and developed future
LUCCs under different socio-economic and
land use scenarios. In particular, future urban
growth was simulated through integrating an
aspatial (the SD model) and a spatially explicit
(the CLUE-S model) urban growth model.
Ecosystem service values for different scenarios were quantified using Xie et al.’s
ecosystem service valuation method. Further,

future land use and ecosystem service value
changes were simulated under three socioeconomic scenarios: (1) current economic
growth, (2) rapid economic growth, and (3)
sustainable economic growth. Analysis of
results suggests several conclusions.
First, from the analysis of land use change
from 2005 to 2015, it can be concluded that the
human-dominated lands, such as built-up land
and barren land, have increased rapidly,
together with a significant decrease of water
body and farmland. The area of built-up land
will increase 38.07% under current economic
growth, 45.37% under rapid economic growth,
or 32.92% under sustainable economic growth.
During the same period, water body is
projected to decrease 47.07%, 65.29%, or
30.78% under these three different socioeconomic and land use scenarios. In addition,
the area of farmland will decrease slightly, and
forest and grassland will increase as the result
of the policy of returning farmland to forest
and grassland.
Second, future ecosystem service values
will vary significantly under different development scenarios. Under the condition of
current economic growth, the total ecosystem
service value will decrease about $165.22
million from 2005 to 2015, a total decrease of
21.71% (2.17% annually). With rapid economic growth, due to the rapid expansion of
built-up land and decline of natural lands (e.g.
water body), the ecosystem service value will
decrease significantly (approximately $242.24
million, or 31.83%). This scenario involves
rapid economic development accompanied by
high risks for natural ecosystems. Finally,
under the condition of sustainable economic
growth, with a relatively low economic growth
rate, low population growth rate, and more
means of environmental protection, the ecosystem service value will decrease slightly
(approximately $106.58 million, or 14%).
When compared to the scenarios with current
and rapid economic growth, the decreasing
rate of ecosystem service value has been
controlled, mainly because the land use

Journal of Spatial Science
transformation from natural lands, particularly
water body and forests, to human-dominated
lands (e.g. built-up and barren lands) has
been slowed down. In addition, as the result
of the policy of returning farmland to forest
and grassland, the ESV of forest and
grassland will increase about 74.40% and
27.34% respectively.
Finally, through exploring the spatial
pattern change of ecosystem service values in
Daqing, China, we found apparent spatial
variations of ESV changes, mainly due to (1)
conversion from water body and farmland to
built-up lands around the city boundary (as
shown in the district A, Figure 3, northeast part
of Daqing City), (2) transformation of forest
and grassland to farmland (as illustrated in
district B, Figure 3, northwest and southwest
of Daqing), (3) the change of natural lands, in
particular water body, to barren lands (shown
in the district C of Figure 3), and (4) the
increment of forest and grassland and slight
decrease of farmland as a result of the policy of
returning farmland to forest and grassland (e.g.
district D in Figure 3, southeast part of
Daqing).
In summary, the combined SD-CLUES
model provides a new means to examine the
spatial change of ecosystem service values
under different development scenarios, which
can offer valuable references to local governments and urban planners. The current
research can be improved in the following
two directions. First, in this study, a combined
impact of urbanisation and petroleum industry
development on ecosystem service values was
examined through the integration of spatially
explicit urban growth modelling and ecosystem service valuation. Their respective contributions, however, cannot be examined with the
current modelling approach. For the purpose of
planning in a resource based city like Daqing,
the identification of respective impacts of
natural urbanisation and petroleum industry
development may provide meaningful references as Daqing is facing the challenges of
urban economic transformation. Second, it is

287

highly necessary to incorporate city planning
maps into land use scenario simulation and
ESV change analysis. Because of data
limitations, we did not incorporate Daqing
city urban planning maps. Urban planning
maps, however, may provide much more
detailed information about the city development trends and facilitate more realistic land
use simulations and ESV change analyses.

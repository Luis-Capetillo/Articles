Mekong Delta

The Mekong Delta faces significant challenges in supplying Vietnam and its export market countries with
agricultural commodities, while ensuring livelihoods and providing living space to its growing population in the
context of climate change and the country’s agrarian transition. Anthropogenic factors, such as the construction
of dykes to control river flooding, river sand mining, the further development of triple-cropping rice production,
and infrastructure development, together with climate change impacts on sediment and water availability, are all
combining to threaten agricultural production. One of the key challenges in sustainable development is the need
to identify plausible future states of agricultural-based socio-ecological systems which draw upon differing
strategies of land management, and to characterise the impacts of these systems on both the landscape and
employment. It was hypothesised from the literature and rapid rural appraisals that each land system can only
provide a certain number of jobs, which was further demonstrated using binomial regressions. We show that the
odds of being employed are lower for intensive agricultural systems (OR=0.78 for triple rice; 0.91 for intensive
aquaculture) than for diversified systems (OR=1.16 for rice-aquaculture; OR=1.63 for mixed fruit trees).
Drawing from workshops with local and national stakeholders, we then used Earth observation and national
census data in a spatial land use systems dynamic framework to simulate two alternative Mekong Delta futures
based upon the climate pathway RCP 4.5 in combination with two existing policies (i) Resolution No. 124
(Specialisation) which promotes triple crop rice and aquaculture intensification and (ii) Resolution No. 639
(Diversification), which states that there should be a development of sustainable rice aquaculture and crop
diversification. Based on the quantitative objectives of each policy, we estimated likely changes of services
provided by land use systems if either policy were to dominate. The estimated impacts of each future scenario on
the provision of employment ultimately indicate that policies with a diversification development paradigm will
provide more employment (+0.9%) than policies with a specialisation paradigm (− 46%), and that current
policies have potentially conflicting consequences. Decisions driving towards intensive farming risk triggering
rural unemployment and outmigration, potentially exacerbating urban poverty in major cities such as Can Tho
and Ho Chi Minh City. On the other hand, decisions aiming at increasing diversified agricultural systems can help
secure more job opportunities. Our results indicate that spatial planning policies should rely on a broad-based
assessment of land system services that include employment and environmental impacts to ensure a just tran­
sition towards resilient and environmentally sustainable rural territories.

efficiency, markets and value chains, delta infrastructure for better
regional connectivity as well as with neighbouring countries, and
improved vocational training with the aim to prevent out-migration.
Regarding aquaculture, the aim is to transform fisheries into a highly
competitive, large-scale commodity production sector and to construct
large fishing centres associated with major fishing grounds, concen­
trated material production zones, industrial parks and consumption
markets. These measures, which oscillate between intensification and
environmental protection, are designed to implement the Mekong Delta
Plan - a strategic spatial plan the general principles of which were first
set out in 2013 (Hutton et al., 2021) and formalised in 2022 with the
Mekong Delta Master Plan. Apart from aforementioned general orien­
tations, plan implementation is supported by a number of sectoral pol­
icies. Of these, decisions 124/939 (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2012a,
2012b) and 639/816 (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2014, 2018) are
central policies governing land use. However, according to local stake­
holders, the objectives of decision 124 are conflicting with decision 639
and with the 2017 Vietnamese Law on Planning. This law clearly stip­
ulates that planning and development should “minimise the negative
impacts due to the economy, society and environment on community
livelihoods” while promoting “the development of the disadvantaged
and slowly-developing areas and sustainable livelihoods for people
therein” (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2017a; Hutton et al., 2021).
While the impacts of land use system changes on the Vietnamese
Mekong Delta’s environment and society are evident, there is a lack of
understanding of how these processes impact livelihoods on the ground.
A better understanding of how policies influence land use systems and
livelihoods is necessary. To address these knowledge gaps, it is impor­
tant to characterise the associations between land use systems and
employment, and to model the impact of spatial planning policies on
future land use systems. In this paper, we combined Earth observation
and national census data in a spatially explicit and dynamic land use
system change model to explore the effects of the two main Vietnamese
land use planning policies on employment and land use systems.

1. Introduction
Major economic and demographic shifts are driving human societies
towards increased food demand food demand with a projected rise of
59–98% by 2050 under the Shared Socio-economic Pathway “Middle of
the Road” (SSP2) (Valin et al., 2014; Tilman et al., 2011). This increased
demand leads to greater land use competition as they provide services
such as food, housing, transportation, energy, employment, and water
(Deichmann et al., 2019). Significant concerns over demand for land use
services cannot be met without causing irreparable damage to the
environment (Giller et al., 2021). Current approaches in land manage­
ment for developing countries are often targeted to maximise economic
factors via extractive models of land use, which exacerbate environ­
mental degradation.
Managing agricultural social-ecological systems requires greater
understanding of existing linkages between land, governance and people
(Kremen and Merenlender, 2018; Hutton et al., 2021). Land use man­
agement, for example, through intensification or extensification of
farming systems, can lead to substantial changes in terms of employ­
ment. High intensity or extractive models of land use may contribute to a
substantial reduction in both quantity and quality of livelihood oppor­
tunities for local communities, which often underpins increased migra­
tion and unskilled labour (Berchoux et al., 2019; Garnett et al., 2013). As
a consequence, policymakers need to balance trade-offs between high
intensity production and sustainability (Hutton et al., 2021), hence
shaping land management strategies through regulatory, voluntary,
financial tools and spatial planning (Kremen and Merenlender, 2018).
The Vietnamese Mekong Delta, covering an extensive area of
approximately 41,000 km2, is home to a significant portion of the
country’s population. As of the 2019 census, Vietnam’s total population
was estimated at 96.2 million, with 17.3 million residing in the Mekong
Delta, of which 12.9 million live in rural areas, underscoring the pre­
dominantly agrarian nature of the region’s livelihoods (General Statis­
tics Office, 2020). However, despite its economic significance, the
Mekong Delta experiences the highest out-migration and negative net
migration rate in Vietnam. In terms of employment, the Statistical
Yearbook reports that the Mekong Delta’s unemployment rate was
estimated to be 4.1% in 2021, which is higher than the national average
of 3.2%. Furthermore, the 2021 report indicates a significant increase in
unemployment from 2.8% in 2020.
This highly complex and dynamic delta that has undergone rapid
changes over the past decades as Vietnam developed economically
(Smajgl et al., 2015). This development has been closely tied to the
expansion of agriculture, primarily rice production, which has been the
driving force behind many technological, economic, and environmental
changes. However, this reliance on rice monoculture has also caused
social unrest and created environmental problems, challenging the local
social-ecological system’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances
(Chapman and Darby, 2016). Moreover, the Vietnamese Mekong Delta is
projected to undergo significant environmental changes, primarily with
respect to salinity intrusion (Eslami et al., 2021a), reduced sediment
fluxes (Bussi et al., 2021; Vasilopoulos et al., 2021), more frequent
climate extremes (floods, droughts) and decreases of precipitation, thus
leading to declining groundwater recharge (Shrestha et al., 2016).
Simultaneously, demographic changes (Szabo et al., 2016) and eco­
nomic orientations (industrial and infrastructure development,
export-oriented commercial agriculture) pose additional challenges to
land use systems by increased demand on some land services.
To address these challenges, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has
passed Resolution 120 on Sustainable and Climate-Resilient Develop­
ment in the Mekong Delta and the Resolution’s 2019 Action Programme
(Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2017, 2019). Both resolutions are
designed to move from a focus on food security towards high quality
food production using a combination of high-tech, large-scale, and
organic agriculture by developing: industry associated with agricultural
production, water resource protection through increased production

2. General approach
We followed a four-steps approach (Fig. 1): (1) characterise associ­
ations between employment and land use systems; (2) identify current
trends of land use systems change; (3) model projections of land use
systems under the combined effects of current policies and environ­
mental change (4) predict employment for each policy scenario based on
projected land use systems. Our working hypothesis is that local-scale
variations in employment are at least partly explained by changes in
land use systems at a higher level, such as the municipality, and thus by
land use planning policies. Overall, the findings of this paper show that
current policies have conflicting objectives with each aiming to produce
differing future land use systems in the Mekong Delta. In particular,
scenarios that favour food production will lead to an increase in the area
of land use systems that support fewer jobs, while scenarios that pro­
mote agricultural diversification will ensure greater employment
opportunities.
3. Methods
3.1. Conceptualising the links between land use systems and employment
Fieldwork on the Mekong River Delta was conducted between April
and May 2018 to understand components of rural livelihoods and land
use systems, from a household perspective, across a range of diverse
socio-ecological contexts. This fieldwork enabled us to characterise
agricultural land use systems and to identify the main associations be­
tween land use, household livelihood strategies, and employment in
each land use system. We used Rapid Rural Appraisal as the principal
field method to collect data and to highlight the perceptions and opin­
ions of representative stakeholders and local residents (see

Land Use Policy 131 (2023) 106752

Fig. 1. Approach used to analyse land use sys­
tems and their associations with employment.
Four steps were followed in the paper: (1) a
territorial assessment characterising patterns of
land use systems and employment; (2) an
assessment of current trends in land use system
changes; (3) a projection of trajectories of land
use systems under global environmental change
(RCP4.5, deltaic subsidence and salinity intru­
sion), exploring different policy options as a
response (specialisation vs. diversification); and
(4) predict employment for each policy sce­
narios based on projected land use systems.

Supplementary Material S1, S2). This method enables local people to
share their knowledge, and to discuss and analyse their situation using
their own terms (Mukherjee, 2005).
In total, ten villages were selected using a stratified sampling design
of the main types of land use systems present in the community. Two
villages for each main land use system (triple rice cropping, double rice
cropping, aquaculture, orchards) were sampled to provide input from a
variety of cases, based on the social-ecological characteristics of the
community and on the main livelihood strategies conducted by house­
holds (Fig. 2). Rapid Rural Appraisals were conducted with 10–15 par­
ticipants per community covering a range of livelihood strategies, socioeconomic, and gender backgrounds. Different appraisal activities with
communities were used to cross-check acquired data and to cover all
aspects of land use systems and livelihoods. First, a participatory
workshop was held as a focus group, where general information about
the village, the land use systems and their evolution was discussed.
Differences within the community regarding livelihood assets and
employment strategies were investigated. Once different livelihood
categories were identified by participants, they quantified the propor­
tion of households falling into each category.

appraisals (tripe rice, double rice, rice-aquaculture, cash crops, fruit
trees, aquaculture, forest-aquaculture, forest, urban), as specified in
Tran et al. (2015). We used the Natural Resources and Environment land
planning maps collected from the local governments during fieldwork to
train the model (stratified training sample, R2 =.85). Finally, we char­
acterised the links between agricultural land use systems, livelihoods
and main types of employment thanks to the qualitative data collected
during the rapid rural appraisals (Supplementary Material).
3.3. Associations between land use systems and employment
Logistic regression was used to investigate the effects of land use
systems on the probability of being employed in a specific sector. Eight
response variables (extracted from the 2010 Census on Population and
Housing in Vietnam) were considered, derived as the number of people
salaried or self-employed in one of the following sectors to total active
population: (i) agriculture; (ii) forestry; (iii) aquaculture; (iv) industry;
(v) construction; (vi) commercial; (vii) transportation; and (viii) inac­
tive. The proportions of the response variables of interest varied
continuously over a bounded range of [0,1]. Thus, an ordinary least
squares regression model would be a model misspecification as it re­
quires a response range over all real numbers. In this regard, a gener­
alised linear model (GLM) with a logit link is a correct model
specification as the logit function transforms the bounded proportion
range from [0,1] to all real numbers as required. As contextual factors,
such as socio-political and market contexts, strongly impact employ­
ment opportunities, outcomes and the ability of households to imple­
ment coping strategies (Berchoux et al., 2020), we used the proportion
of ethnic minorities and travel duration as confounders to control for
such factors.

3.2. Characterising land use systems
Land use systems reflect a multi-functionality of landscapes, by
taking into account land use, land management, and water management
through irrigation infrastructures and practices (Malek et al., 2018). At
the time of conducting the study, there was no delta-wide land use
system map that included non-rice agricultural systems available for
both 2010 and 2020. Some studies had created maps of a portion of the
Delta (Truong et al., 2022), some for the whole delta but only for years
2010 and 2014 (Nguyen et al., 2015), while others only categorised rice
agricultural systems (Vu et al., 2022). As a consequence, we generated
our own land use systems maps by using supervised classification to
ensure comparability between 2010 and 2020.
We used MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)
data to derive NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) from a
total of 46 MOD09Q1 cloud-free images at 8-days interval for each year,
with a resolution of 250 m. We used maximum likelihood classification
on NDVI time series (Fig. 3) to derive 9 land use systems classes repre­
senting the main agricultural systems identified during rapid rural

3.4. Projections of land use system change

to the main land use orientations of the development plans for the
Mekong Delta: a scenario “Specialisation”, based on the pair of decisions
No.124 and No. 939 (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2012a, 2012b),
which promote triple crop rice and aquaculture intensification; and (ii) a
scenario “Diversification” for the pair of decisions No. 639 and No. 816
(Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2014, 2018), which state that there
should be a development of sustainable rice aquaculture and crop
diversification (Supplementary Material S2).
For all scenarios, stakeholder input was key in setting model pa­
rameters during workshops, which were based on an analysis of policy
decisions affecting the development orientations of the Mekong Delta
(Hutton et al., 2021). Each scenario was modelled using different pro­
visions of services (ability of each land use system to provide a service),
demands for services (policy objectives) and spatial constraints. The
latter represents transitions from one land use system to another, which
were strictly prohibited or only allowed by predefined changes. For
example, conversions from single-season rice to intensive aquaculture
and later to triple rice were facilitated in the “Specialisation” scenario
based on decision No. 124 to reflect the policy orientations found in the
decision: “convert some one-rice crop in water-logged areas into fish or
shrimp areas” and “to increase the area of triple rice and to do intensive
farming”. On the contrary, transitions to single rice were encouraged in
the Decision No. 639 scenario, based on the policy statement “to in­
crease the area of rice-aquaculture in both fresh and brackish water,
rotationally lush flood into fields”, while aquaculture and orchards were
favoured compared to intensive freshwater rice area.

Plausible land use systems for 2030 were developed using CLU­
Mondo, a model that simulates land use system change as a function of
exogenously derived demands for commodities and services while ac­
counting for local suitability and competition between land use systems
(Van Asselen and Verburg, 2012). While other approaches to predict
future land use like Cellular Automata (Rahaman et al., 2022) use past
dynamics to derive future dynamics, CLUMondo can simulate future
projections based on different scenario parameters that can be informed
by current policies (Supplementary Material S3). The 2020 land use
system map of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta was used as a baseline. For
each year, a suitability map was created using logistic regression be­
tween the distribution of each land use system and a set of explanatory
factors (Diep et al., 2022) (Supplementary Material S3). A total of 21
biophysical and socioeconomic explanatory variables were used.
Explanatory variables included static factors that were assumed to not
change over the ten years modelling span, such as soil properties, water
logging, population density (we accounted for population change
through demand, which drove the model), and access to markets. We
also added dynamic factors that updated yearly to represent climate
change under RCP4.5, including climate variables from CMIP6 models
(Fick and Hijmans, 2017) and salinity projections (Eslami et al., 2021b).
Land use systems in 2030 were simulated under two different sce­
narios (Table 1), which were based on sets of demands for commodities
and services from existing policy decisions (built-up, agricultural prod­
ucts, aquatic products). Policy-based scenarios were designed according

4. Results

Aquaculture, rice-aquaculture, and forest land use systems had a
statistically significant positive effect on the odds of engaging in fisheryrelated employment, while agricultural and urban land use systems had
a negative effect. Aquaculture had the greatest positive effect on
providing fishery-related employment (OR = 7.12, 95% CI = [6.71,
7.57]), followed by mixed land use systems: rice-aquaculture and forestaquaculture. Moreover, ethnic minority inclusion reduced the odds of
engaging in a fishery-related job (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = [0.47, 0.49]).
For non-farming employment, land use systems with a greater share
of urban areas increased the odds of engaging in commercial activities,
construction activities, industrial activities and transport activities.
Four fitted models were used to analyse the effects of land use sys­
tems on labour types (Table 3). Agricultural and urban land use systems
had a statistically significant positive effect on the odds of being sala­
ried, urban land use systems having the greatest effect (OR = 5.75, 95%
CI = [5.42, 6.10]), followed by cash crops, double rice, triple rice and
fruits. On the contrary, the share of forest (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = [0.63,
0.73]), rice-aquaculture and aquaculture decreased the odds of being
salaried compared to being self-employed. Finally, ethnic minority in­
clusion increased the odds of being salaried compared to selfemployment (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = [1.30, 1.34]). In terms of

4.1. Employment opportunities in complex land use systems
Odds ratios (OR) were used to quantify the relationships between the
response variable (employment or labour type) and the explanatory
variables (land use systems), controlling for travel time to the closest
district capital and the effects of ethnic minorities. An odds ratio above
one indicates that, as the explanatory variable increases, the odds of
being employed in a specific sector or labour type also increases.
Concerning the effects of land use systems on main employment
sectors (Table 2), agricultural land use systems (triple rice, double rice,
cash crops, fruits) had a significant (p ≤ 0.001) positive effect on the
odds of engaging in agricultural employment, while other land use
systems (forest, aquaculture, mixed rice-aquaculture, urban) had a sig­
nificant negative effect. Fruits/orchards had the greatest positive effect
on providing agricultural employment (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = [1.92,
2.11]), cash crops had the lowest, and double rice had a greater effect
(OR = 1.85, 95% CI = [1.77, 1.94]) compared to triple rice. Moreover,
ethnic minority inclusion increased the odds of engaging in an agricul­
tural job (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = [1.55, 1.59]).

employment, a greater share of forest (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = [1.79,
2.17]), fruits, urban, cash crops or rice-aquaculture increased the odds
of being active compared to inactive. On the contrary, a greater share of
triple rice (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = [1.20, 1.38]), double rice or aqua­
culture increased the odds of being inactive compared to being active.
Similarly, ethnic minority inclusion also increased the odds of being
inactive compared to being active (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = [1.07, 1.12]).
As shown in the model summary (Fig. 4), triple rice, double rice and
intensive aquaculture systems increase the likelihood of being unem­
ployed. In these land use systems, the main source of employment is
agriculture or aquaculture. As most of the work is mechanised, only
petty tasks provide employment to landless households. Although there
is a peak in labour demand during harvest, farmers tend to hire large
organised groups of labourers from other provinces, which drives
landless locals into migration to the industrial zones, especially in triple
rice cropping systems. In the double rice cropping system, flooded fields
provide fishing for home consumption (for better-off households) or to
generate income by selling fish on the road side (for landless house­
holds), enabling the poorest households the opportunity to generate a
livelihood.

Agriculture 51.9%; aquaculture 40% (No.639)

Reduce freshwater and ineffective rice systems, increase aquaculture and
orchards (No.816); increase rice-aquaculture area (No.639)

One model was fitted to analyse the effects of the type of employment
on the odds of falling under the poverty line for people within the legal
working ages of 15–64 (Table 4). It was apparent that ethnic minority
inclusion had the greatest positive effect on the odds of being poor (OR
= 3.16, 95% CI = [2.98, 3.35]). Being unemployed (OR = 1.35, 95% CI
= [1.16, 1.57]), being employed in the fishery sector, or in agriculture
increased the odds of falling into poverty. On the contrary, engaging in
non-farming activities decreased the odds of being poor (OR = 0.64,
95% CI = [0.59, 0.69]).
4.2. Current trends of land use systems
In 2010, double rice was the land use system with the largest
coverage in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (35%), followed by triple rice
(19%), fruits (14%), aquaculture (12%), forest-aquaculture (9%), riceaquaculture (6%), cash crops (4%) and urban (1%). By 2020, triple
rice became the land use system with the largest coverage (32%), fol­
lowed by double rice (24%), aquaculture (15%), fruits (10%), forestaquaculture (7%), rice-aquaculture (6%), cash crops (5%) and urban
(1%). The biggest changes that occurred between 2010 and 2020 were

derived from MODIS data.

the conversion of 34% of the 2010 double rice area and 23% of the 2010
fruits area into triple rice area (Fig. 5), which is in line with national
statistics and estimations (Hui et al., 2022; Van Kien et al., 2020). The
increase in aquaculture area was mostly due to the conversion of 35% of
the 2010 rice-aquaculture area to aquaculture, while the increase in cash
crops was mostly due to the conversion of 4% of the 2010 double rice
area. Overall, we found that 58% of the Mekong area did not face land
system change between 2010 and 2020. In particular, the two most
specialised land use systems had little conversion of their areas to other
land use system (84% of persistence for aquaculture and 83% of
persistence for triple rice), while only half of the area of the others land
use systems persisted: 53% for double rice, 48% for fruit trees and for
rice-aquaculture.
Based on the model “Active” previously depicted, we predicted
employment opportunities in 2020 based on land use systems

distribution and controlling for population change (+0.9% annual in­
crease). We found that land use systems transitions observed between
2010 and 2020 have led to a 3.2% decrease in employment.
4.3. Projected changes of land use systems and their impacts on
employment
The largest expansions of triple rice areas were observed under the
specialisation scenario in the West (Trans-Bassac depression), NorthWest (Long Xuyen-Ha Tien quadrangle), and in the North East (Plain
of Reeds) following the intensification of double rice cropping systems
into triple rice, while such a transition remained moderated in the
diversification scenario (Fig. 5). As a consequence, double rice systems
only covered 9% of the total area under the specialisation scenario,

compared to 25% under the diversification scenario. Symmetrically,
triple rice systems covered 37% (scenario specialisation) and 20%
(scenario diversification) of the total area (Table 5). More riceaquaculture systems were preserved in the diversification policy sce­
nario: 3% more compared to the specialisation scenario. In the two
scenarios, the area of intensive aquaculture increased around the SouthWest (Cà Mau peninsula), ranging between 18% (diversification sce­
nario) and 27% (specialisation scenario) of the total area. Of the two
scenarios, cash crops were the land use system that decreased the most,
disappearing completely in the specialisation scenario while only a very
small area remained under the diversification scenario, located on the
South-East (coastal flat) near Trà Vinh. The reduction in cash crop land
use systems in the freshwater alluvial area near Cần Thơ is mostly due to
conversion to orchards and rice land use systems. There was also a
substantial increase in urban systems (+14%) in the Cà Mau peninsula
under the specialisation scenario at the expense of rice-aquaculture and
fruits. (Fig. 6).
The overall change in employment opportunities between 2020 and
2030 (Table 5) is higher (+0.9%) under the diversification scenario than
under the specialisation scenario (− 46.0%). However, an increase in
employment opportunities under the diversification scenario comes at
the expense of agricultural gross product (diversification − 6.8%;
specialisation − 1.0%). Interestingly, despite an increase of intensive
aquaculture under the specialisation scenario, overall relative change of
aquaculture gross product is the lowest in such a scenario (specialisation
− 13.6%; diversification − 6.5%). Finally, as urban sprawl was con­
strained in the diversification scenarios, the relative change in built-up
area is significantly lower in this scenario (− 8.2%) while it grew
under the specialisation scenario (+2.9%).

Our findings show that mode of production has a significant effect on
employment provision. Intensive farming land use systems (rice mono­
culture, aquaculture) support less employment than more diversified
systems, thus supporting earlier findings, which demonstrated that
transitions from shifting cultivation to intensive cropping has a negative
impact on employment opportunities (Dressler et al., 2017; Tran, 2019).
The results of our study demonstrate that diversified farming systems
(forest-aquaculture, orchards, rice-aquaculture), as promoted under
decision 639, support more employment, yet they do not require a large
agricultural labour force in comparison with decision 124. As agricul­
tural land use systems are more diversified (e.g. smaller fields), they
provide more alternative employment opportunities for landless
households than decision 639, such as employment in processing com­
panies and small businesses (packaging, upcycling of agri-processing
waste) (Brunerová et al., 2020). Finally, we showed that access to
urban areas decreases the likelihood of unemployment, thanks to the
provision of off-farm employment (industry, construction, transport) (de
Bruin et al., 2021).
5.2. Sustainability of the Mekong Delta under global environmental
change and current policies
Despite the commitment to sustainable agriculture in post-2013
policies, Decisions 124 and 939 (2012) aim at intensifying production
through the transition from one-rice crop into water-logged areas with
intensive aquaculture and by increasing rice production through triple
rice cropping. This strategic planning is expected to lead to a growth of
production of 4.2% with the following farm-related GDP outputs: agri­
culture (55%), aquaculture (43.5%) and forestry (1.5%). The results
from our model show that achieving this target under RCP4.5 will lead
to exacerbating current observed trends, with an increase in intensive
aquaculture and triple rice cropping systems at the expense of riceaquaculture, forest-aquaculture and double rice cropping systems. This
land planning strategy is vulnerable to global environmental change, as
the three main land use systems (triple rice cropping, intensive aqua­
culture, orchards) will face (i) hot temperatures during the rainy season,
leading to heat stress (rice and shrimp farming); (ii) prolonged rain
during the wet season, leading to floods (rice and orchards); and (iii)
salinity intrusion (orchards). Moreover, such systems lead to increased
conflicts of natural resource management regarding water allocation but
also cross-field contamination and pollution (Tran et al., 2021). Finally,
while the policy narrative emphasises the need to prevent out-migration,
our findings show that pushing for intensive farming decreases
employment opportunities by 46%, especially for low-skilled labourers.
Decisions 639 and 816 (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2014, 2018)

5. Discussion
5.1. Land use systems and employment opportunities
Understanding the links between land use systems and the services
they provide under increasing pressure exerted by global environmental
change is a central part in spatial planning and sustainable management
of resources, as it underpins a balance of options for land use (Kremen
and Merenlender, 2018). However, current approaches to spatial plan­
ning are often targeted on maximising economic value via extractive
models of land use, thus exacerbating environmental degradation. While
the latest evidence emphasises the importance of explicitly including
livelihood provision in agri-food system planning (Davis et al., 2022), no
earlier studies have quantitatively explored the associations between
land use systems and employment opportunities.

have objectives that align better with Resolution 120 and its Action
Programme, but also with national-level climate change policies such as
the 2021 National Strategy on Green Growth and the 2017 Sustainable
Development Goals National Action Plan. They take climate change into
account (transition of rice land to aquaculture due to sea-level-rise) and
aim at decreasing the area of ineffective and freshwater land use systems

(especially rice area), while increasing more diversified systems
(rice-aquaculture, forest-aquaculture and orchards). In parallel, they
aim to develop programs that create opportunities for agricultural
labourers while accompanying livelihood transition. The findings from
our model suggest that these two strategic decisions lead to a more
balanced approach in land services in 2030 compared to the

implementation of Decisions 124 and 939. Although favouring
rice-aquaculture and double rice cropping systems to triple rice cropping
systems negatively affects agricultural production, it is greatly improved
compared to the other scenario, while livelihood opportunities remain
stable. The greater diversity of land use systems reduces vulnerability to
global environmental change that prevents yield loss by reducing sedi­
ment starvation associated with triple rice cropping (Chapman and
Darby, 2016).
In practice, however, considerable obstacles remain as tensions
continue to exist in the policy landscape between intensification and
sustainability, which threatens to derail the sustainability goals in
favour of a GDP-centred growth model (Hutton et al., 2021). Although
provincial governments were successfully brought on board during the
formulation of the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan (Seijger et al., 2017; Vo
et al., 2019), a lack of political will and financial resources are proving
to be obstacles for strategic spatial planning and the realisation of sus­
tainability goals (Malekpour et al., 2017; Demazière, 2018; Gustafsson
et al., 2019) that would put the Mekong delta onto a path towards a
climate resilient future.

policy goals under RCP4.5 may lead to a drastic increase in intensive
aquaculture and triple rice cropping systems at the expense of more
diversified systems. We argue that inclusion of employment opportu­
nities as a policy target leads to more diversified systems that provide
more employment without compromising overall agriculture and
aquaculture gross product.
This paper provides an approach for researchers and policy-makers
to consider employment in land use planning policy design, and thus
to target specific land use systems to maximise their environmental and
social services rather than solely focusing on their economic value per
unit. Future interventions should address rural development holistically
rather than focus on agricultural development, or at least ensure that
current planning policies do not have a detrimental effect on rural
employment. As such, they should support transitions to off-farm live­
lihoods in well-connected communities, while steering to more diver­
sified land use systems that could offer on-farm livelihoods to landless
households.
Declaration of Competing Interest

5.3. Implications for sustainable and inclusive strategic spatial planning

All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

In this study, we translated land use planning policies into a land use
change modelling framework. In analysing global change effects on local
scale land management, we went beyond applying global demand pro­
jections only. We developed two scenarios representing the main Viet­
namese planning policies under climate change and salinity intrusion
(RCP4.5). One caveat to this study is that policy scenarios were
modelled as mutually exclusive (specialisation vs. diversification). In
reality, both scenarios might coexist spatially and across scales,
depending on implementing agencies and place-based strategic de­
cisions by local governments. Moreover, our prediction of employment
based solely on land use system do not capture the complexity of live­
lihood strategies that households put in place in rural areas. Nonethe­
less, the patterns that we found allow us to advocate for the inclusion of
employment as a service of land use systems in planning policies. Putting
employment at the core of land use planning facilitates a more balanced
future, situated in the middle of the two current strategies in terms of
agriculture and aquaculture gross product, while ensuring an increase in
livelihood opportunities.
Our modelling approach has a caveat that assumes the association
between land use systems and employment remains constant over time.
Furthermore, to develop a full picture of rural employment, additional
studies are needed, which include gender-sensitive modelling ap­
proaches (Markussen et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the above findings
suggest several courses of action for public policies and schemes to
sustain rural livelihoods and reduce rural out-migration; hence,
reducing urban and rural poverty. We show the necessity of moving
from a profit-driven model of land use systems, as seen in current
agricultural policies around the world (Garrone et al., 2019), towards a
more holistic approach incorporating livelihood and biodiversity goals
in rural policy design. Characterising the extent to which livelihoods can
be supported by land use systems contributes to the wider framework of
ecosystem services that helps design more socially and environmentally
viable strategies for the future.

This study determined associations between land use systems and
employment opportunities and to model future land use systems in the
Vietnamese Mekong Delta under global environmental change and
current policies. Our findings bring a new perspective on land use sys­
tem science and livelihood studies by demonstrating that more intensive
farming systems provide less employment opportunities than more
diversified systems at a territorial level. We showed that current
development policies potentially have conflicting aims and that current

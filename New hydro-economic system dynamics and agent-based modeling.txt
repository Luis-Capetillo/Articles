Water scarcity invariably poses a threat to the sustainability of cities and rural areas with limited resources,
especially in developing countries. This paper presents a new hydro-economic model based on system dynamics
and agent-based simulation to enhance the sustainability of urban groundwater. Dynamic pricing was performed
based on several parameters, such as resource conditions, price elasticity, consumption history and climate
change, to improve the sustainability of groundwater and cover the costs of implementing strategies. Different
scenarios based on pricing, rationing, culturalizing, and non-revenue water control strategies were applied in the
village of Dehno in Yazd Province as the case study with an arid climate. The results showed that several sce­
narios can achieve the goal, but, in drought conditions, only a combination of all the strategies will work.

1. Introduction
Growing human activities, rapid socio-economic development and
drought conditions have caused changes in water-related environmental
issues, such as long-term shortage of water resources, rapid deteriora­
tion of water quality, scarcity, and degeneration of aquatic ecosystems.
These changes are detrimental to the coordinated management of water
systems for sustainable urban and rural areas (Cui, Chen, Xue, Li, &
Zeng, 2019; Echeverría, 2020). In recent years, most Middle Eastern
countries have experienced a growing scarcity of freshwater resources.
This scarcity, along with pollution, calls for a change in water policies
and a better focus on the society’s preferences in connection with the use
of water and development, thus to ensure the availability and sustain­
able management of water and sanitation for all (SDG6). Water man­
agement, as it is nowadays, does not adequately tend to modify the
existing policies, derive the necessary directives, or bring water issues
under long-term planning (Ho, Alonso, Forio, Vanclooster, & Goethals,
2020). Changing the focus of water management approaches from
supply to demand can improve water conservation and sustainability. In
this respect, specific adaptive management policies are needed for a
transition towards groundwater sustainability. Sustainability in this
sense would refer to the exploitation of water resources for the present

needs while maintaining them for future generations without adverse
environmental, economic and social consequences (Yusuf et al., 2020).
Achieving this goal entails pricing, public awareness, culturalization,
technical tools, water recycling and sewage systems (Hof, Blázquez-Sa­
lom, & Garau, 2018). Hydro-economic solutions can serve as promising
tools for the more efficient management of water resources (Alamanos,
Latinopoulos, Papaioannou, & Mylopoulos, 2019). Scarcity pricing is an
effective strategy to reduce demand while simultaneously generating
additional revenues (Sahin, Siems, Stewart, & Porter, 2016). Setting low
water prices leads to water wastage and is considered as an ineffective
policy in a water management system. (Mercadier & Brenner, 2020).
There are several methods to solve the complexity of water manage­
ment, hydro-economic modeling, and inclusion of complex parameters
such as feedback, interdependence and emergence (Guerrero, Schwarz,
& Slinger, 2016). Using an agent-based or system dynamics model is an
example of such methods. In an agent-based model, the behavior of the
system emerges bottom-up from the interactions of individuals with one
another and with their environment based on a set of pre-specified rules.
A system dynamics model, however, represents the behavioral pattern of
the system based on generalizable underlying structures whose main
elements are endogenous feedback and accumulation of quantities over
time. Unlike the agent-based method, a system dynamics model is

usually presented at an aggregate level (i.e., with a top-down structure)
and has broader boundaries (Morshed, Kasman, Heuberger, Hammond,
& Hovmand, 2019).
A lot of research has been done in the fields of hydro-economics and
water pricing for sustainable urban water management. Tortajada,
González-Gómez, Biswas, and Buurman (2019) reviewed water demand
management strategies for water-scarce cities in Spain. The result
showed that education, awareness raising for water conservation and
promotion of water-saving technologies have major impacts on sus­
tainable water consumption. Babamiri, Pishvaee, and Mirzamohammadi
(2020) conducted a financial analysis of sustainable management stra­
tegies of urban water distribution networks under an increasing block
tariff structure with a system dynamics approach. Rojas, Garcia-Vega,
and Herrera-Torres (2019) explored economic policies and their role
as a tool for managing the sustainability of water resources. Lopez-Ni­
colas, Pulido-Velazquez, Rougé, Harou, and Escriva-Bou (2018) showed
the best urban water-saving solution based on economic solutions.
Molinos-Senante and Donoso (2016) examined the impact of water
tariffs on drought conditions for sustainable urban water management.
They showed that hydro-economic modeling improves water use sus­
tainability. Fan (2019) explored hydro-economic models of sustainable
water resource management. Sahin et al. (2016) offered several methods
to control demand, such as pricing in drought conditions. They also
advocated hydro-economic models to protect urban water during
droughts (Sahin, Bertone, Beal, & Stewart, 2018). Massarutto (2020)
reviewed the theoretical and applied literature in the field of residential
water economic models. He provided many examples of approaches and
solutions that are more consistent with the sustainability theory. Mer­
cadier and Brenner (2020) analyzed tariff sustainability in Buenos Aires
water and sanitation concessions amidst economic instability. Water
scarcity exerts a significant influence on price elasticity and sustainable
cities. If water scarcity is severe, household responsiveness to prices
decreases, though this effect is attenuated in environmentally concerned
communities (Garrone, Grilli, & Marzano, 2019). Favre and Montginoul
(2018) reviewed hydro-economic models in Tunisia for the sustain­
ability of cities and showed the cost-recovery principle strongly depends
highly on high-consumption households. The affordability principle was
found to only concern piped households. The averaging-out principle
does not indicate the local scarcity value of water. Al-Saidi (2017)
reviewed urban water economic models for sustainable consumption in
Yemen. He compared increasing block tariffs with other pricing
schemes.
Due to the excessive extraction of groundwater for intense agricul­
tural activities, Yazd plain, a water-scarce district in the center of Iran,
has been faced with a serious water crisis during the past decade. This is
more or less like the conditions in the other regions of Iran. Appropriate
pricing can have a positive effect on water consumption in Iran. In some
past research works, the extent of this effect is calculated. Through a
systematic review and meta-analysis, Shadivand, SAYEH, and ASKARI
(2019) investigated the factors affecting the price and income elasticity
of household water demand in Iran. Using Rosenthal and Robin’s
approach in the systematic review, the effects of price and income
elasticities were calculated for household water demand. Then, based on
the heterogeneity of the calculated effects, random and fixed models
were used to combine the results. Rezaee and Shojaa (2020) estimated
the income and the price elasticity of Kermanshah urban water demand.
Price elasticity indicates a negative correlation between price changes
and water demand. If the price of water increases by 10 %, the demand
for it will decrease by 4.3 %. Abolhasani, Tajabadi, and Shahnoushi
Forushahi (2018) reviewed 21 empirical case studies in Iran from which
65 estimates of price elasticity for residual water demand were
collected. The inclusion of income, use of time-series datasets, natural
logarithm function of demand and application of the stone-gray theory
were all found to affect the estimate of price elasticity. The population
density and the use of OLS techniques to estimate the demand param­
eters did not significantly influence the estimate of price elasticity.

To implement a hydro-economic model of urban water management,
practical straightforward measures, effective incentives, and fines
should be taken into consideration. This makes water consumption
optimal (Sharifi, 2020). For example, the inclusion of a subscriber’s
consumption history in pricing may create an incentive for saving, or an
exponential increase in prices as a fine may be a deterrent for those who
consume a lot. Paying attention to these points complements the
research work of others. For urban water sustainability management,
this study proposes a model with hydro-economic considerations in
social and individual dimensions. The price dimension includes cost,
supply-demand balance, resource conditions (i.e., the sustainability of
groundwater), and rainfall. The bill, which represents the households
section of water pricing, is calculated based on consumption pattern,
history, price elasticity, and comparison with others. This case study was
planned to focus on the sustainability of urban groundwater. It was due
to its special circumstances that the village of Dehno in the province of
Yazd was selected for the study. The area has a dry climate and is beset
with an extended drought. The purpose of the study is not to determine
the price-demand or elasticity function; rather, water pricing is
considered as a tool to control consumption in favor of groundwater
sustainability. It also covers the costs of the proposed strategies.
As indicated in Fig. 1, the study was carried out through a number of
steps. After the problem was identified, an area was selected for a case
study. Once the possible solutions were reviewed for the problem, a
hypothesis was extracted. The problem was modeled through system
dynamics and agent-based methods. The pricing formula, taxes, duties
and incentives were calculated too. The results of the model simulation
were consistent with the past real behavior of households, and the
structure was successfully evaluated through a test. Then, different
scenarios of demand management were tested to select the best one that
could maintain the sustainability of water resources in drought condi­
tions, meet the costs of the water supply company, and cause the least
dissatisfaction.
The rest of this paper is organized into several parts. The second part
presents the methodology of the study. In the third part, the results of
strategy implementation are offered, and the fourth part discusses those
results. Finally, the fifth part ends the paper with the conclusion.
2. Methodology
2.1. Case study
Dehno is a rural area in the province of Yazd, Iran, with a population
of about 5000 in 1000 families. The area has arid climatic conditions
with low rainfall and high evaporation. It is located far from seas (500
km to the Persian Gulf and 700 km to the Caspian Sea) and in the vicinity
of a vast desert with low relative humidity and high temperature
(Fig. 2).
Dehno has been selected for a case study for several reasons:
a) The area has an arid climate. Recently, it has suffered from
drought, and precipitation has decreased significantly. Prolonged
drought and increased demand for water have led to an uncontrolled
increase in water abstraction from wells. This has caused a significant
reduction in groundwater resources.
b) The village is located at the distance of 10 km from Yazd, but it
seems connected to Yazd due to the enlargement of the city. Its climate is
the same as that in Yazd. The demand for water has increased signifi­
cantly due to the population growth, the expansion of the water supply
network, and the occurrence of drought. Therefore, the volume of
groundwater has significantly reduced. Based on the opinions of the
experts at ABFA Company, if this trend continues for less than eight
years, the resources will dry up. In recent years, as Piezo metrics suggest,
the groundwater in Yazd-Ardakan aquifers has gone down due to
drought and excessive consumption, and the role of rainfall has become
greater than before (Fig. 3). These conditions are true about Dehno too;
the demand for water has increased, and the volume of groundwater has

boom, 2020).

(Fig. 6) and have used urban water to irrigate plants. In the recent
drought, agricultural water resources have dried up. This has led to a
large increase in consumption and a critical situation in drinking water
resources. Fig. 7 compares the average consumption values in Yazd and
Dehno from 2009 to 2019. The average consumption per person has
increased in Dehno but decreased in Yazd. Due to the low price of do­
mestic water in the village, households have also used it for agriculture
in drought conditions.
All the figures and the tables about the case study area were obtained
from ABFA, Yazd Water Resources Company, and expert opinions in this
company.
2.2. Hypothesis
Before the study was launched, it was hypothesized that a combi­
nation of demand management and pricing policies would maintain the
sustainability of groundwater resources in drought conditions in Dehno,
Yazd.
2.3. Modeling
Water management involves a complex system of different factors
and behaviors that influence one another. To model such a system, first,
the main variables were extracted through a review of the literature and
(Arasteh & Farjami, 2021). Then, the relationships among the variables
were identified based on a causal-loop diagram, which is one of the best
tools to determine the types of relationships among system variables.
Fig. 8 shows a causal loop diagram of six main loops in hydro-economic
modeling, including consumption, price change, revenue, population,
supply, and waste loops. All the loops were corrective. Price-related
loops were extracted to determine the extent of the hydro-economic
impact on the other factors.

decreased (Fig. 4).
c) The region has more than 30 wells that supply Dehno and Yazd
drinking networks. Therefore, water management in the region is very
important for ABFA.
d) The main sources of water in the region are groundwater and the
water transferred from Isfahan Province. Fig. 5 addresses the supply of
water from these sources. As it turns out, the majority of consumption is
for groundwater.
e) The garden houses are located among the agricultural lands

system behavior. The system dynamics method is a top-down one and
can be applied to high-aggregation cases (i.e., high-abstraction cases). It
assumes that all processes are continuous and makes use of multiple
feedback mechanisms, delays, and complex non-linear processes
described by differential equations. On the other hand, the agent-based
methods use a bottom-up perspective, deal with discrete processes, and
handle middle-to-low aggregation (i.e., low abstraction). A value prop­
osition of agent-based modeling tools is the ability to capture the dy­
namics at work between the multiple autonomous agents and the
heterogeneous groups of agents interacting in a system (Wilensky &
Rand, 2015). In Fig. 9, the simulation environment can be seen as a part
of the system dynamics with a stock and flow diagram. The stocks
include reservoirs, groundwater, surface water, households, dynamic
price, profit, culture, waste, and theft percentage. The Anylogic v8.05
software was used to model the dynamics of the agents, namely the
households in the agent-based section and the stock and flow diagram in
the system dynamics section. The model was divided into the following
subsystems which interacted with one another:
Water supply subsystem: This subsystem includes a groundwater,
surface water, and sewage treatment network. The water conservation
sector must adopt control policies to protect water resources. For
example, surface water volume equals the sum of rainwater and river
water minus overflow, soil infiltration and surface evaporation. The
green area in Fig. 9 shows this subsystem.
Demand and balance subsystem: The purpose of this subsystem is
to balance the supply and demand in the drinking water network. The
yellow area in Fig. 9 shows this subsystem.
People are the agents of the system. Fig. 10 shows the households
that are part of the demand system. With a click on each household, its

In the next step, it was necessary to determine the main variables and
the sub-variables based on the reference model. Table 1 shows the main
variables of the system. The simulation column specifies which variable
belongs to the simulation method. The formula column shows the
method of calculation.
Due to the complexity and interactivity of the factors, a combination
of system dynamics and agent-based methods was used to model the

to the quality of water itself. NRW is typically measured as the volume of
the water lost, which is a part of the net water produced (AL-Washali,
Elkhider, Sharma, & Kennedy, 2020; Torkaman, Ahmadi, & Aminnejad,
2021). This subsystem reduces water loss and increases consumption
through developing a distribution network. Therefore, network devel­
opment should be cautious concerning resource capacity. It should also
regard waste reduction, household monitoring, and wastewater reuse.
The treated wastewater contributes to the supply of water to farmlands
and non-drinking usages. The subsystem is shown in the maroon area of
Fig. 9.
Awareness subsystem: It serves to raise households’ awareness and
create incentives for proper consumption. The blue area in Fig. 9 shows
this subsystem.
Cost and revenue subsystem: The purpose is for cost recovery
through dynamic pricing. To determine costs and revenue, a stock is
considered as the profit, and the monthly costs including the cost of
awareness, smart meter, network modification, and monitoring are
deducted from it. The revenues come from operations, bills, grants, and
government budgets. Consequently, the costs can be applied based on
the existing profit, which forms a dynamic cycle. A rise in the price in­
creases the revenue and offsets some of the company’s costs. The com­
pany spends part of its revenue on household awareness, network
refinement, optimization of water use, and balancing the supply and
demand in the long run. The red area in Fig. 9 shows this subsystem.
The dynamic pricing function is part of this subsystem. Proper and
fair water pricing has two advantages. It saves water and gives in­
centives to save. It also pays off NRW control and cultural costs. In
pricing, justice should be ranked first. Second, household incentives or
savings should be taken into account. Third, there should be excessive
consumption fines. In this study, water pricing is done in the dimensions
of price and bills. The price is based on water balance, resource sus­
tainability, climate change, rationing, inflation, and management fac­
tors. If there is an overflow, certain incentives are provided for
consumption in agriculture and industry. This part of the price algorithm
is calculated based on system dynamics. The price is the same for all the
households and is calculated in each period (i.e. per month).

specifications and the amount of its consumption are displayed on a new
page. Each household is characterized in terms of age, gender, number
of members, income, consumption, bill, the possibility of theft or con­
sumption without a meter, and satisfaction.
NRW control subsystem: Non-revenue water (NRW) is the water
produced but lost before it reaches the customer. Losses can be real
losses (through leaks, sometimes referred to as physical losses) or
apparent losses (through theft or metering inaccuracies). High levels of
NRW are detrimental both to the financial viability of water utilities and

Price elasticity must be involved too. Water is inelastic for essential
usages such as drinking, food preparation and sanitation (Price elasticity
for this usage is between -0.30 and -0.10), but it is elastic for such tasks
as recreational sports and non-essential usages like irrigation and
washing. In this study, the results of several other studies including
Abolhasani et al. (2018), Karimlou, Hassani, Mehrabadi, and Nazari
(2019), Rezaee and Shojaa (2020), Shadivand et al. (2019) and Taja­
badi, Abolhassani, and Shahnoushi (2018) were used to calculate the
Price Elasticity. It is considered as a variable based on household in­
come. The amount of household income was calculated with regard to
the household size and the amount of household consumption.
Accordingly, households and price elasticity were divided into three
levels. Based on the findings, an increase in the price had an opposite
effect on the consumption. Also, the increase in the price had the
greatest impact on the middle class.

the household bills. The variable column introduces the influential
factors in the pricing formula, and the description column gives defi­
nitions and interpretations for the variables.

3. Results
3.1. Model validation
A model can simulate the behavior of a system reliably only if the
designer includes his real needs in it (Homer & Oliva, 2001). There are
different evaluation and validation methods to compare simulated and
actual data (Barlas, 1996), including the tests introduced by Forrester
and Barlas (Legasto, Forrester, & Lyneis, 1980; Sweeney & Sterman,
2000). The time was divided into two periods, from 2018 to 2019 for a
two-year evaluation and comparison with the past and from 2019 to
2025 for a five-year simulation. There are three tests to evaluate the
model as follows:
a. Structure validation: The model is run over a long period (15
years). According to Fig. 11a, the structure is relatively stable, but, with
the continuation of the current trend from month 144 (in the year 2033),
the groundwater resources will be in a critical state.
b. Repetition of the behavior: The model is run several times to
evaluate its behavior (Fig. 11b). Slight changes indicate the uncertainty
of the model. However, they still follow the same structure.

Fig. 11. Model validation.

c. Comparison with the past: The model is compared to the real
system behavior in the two years before the simulation (from 2019 to
2021). As shown in Fig. 11c, the model simulation matches the past. This
test serves to calibrate the water demand function with the real data.
The real data are based on the consumption of the households and the
annual report of ABFA resource status in the case study during the twoyear period before the simulation.
The factors that affect the amount of consumption include the
change of water prices, prevention of unauthorized use, proper con­
sumption culture, and forcible reduction of consumption through ra­
tioning. To determine the best method in drought conditions, it is
necessary to set a series of scenarios, make reviews, and compare the
simulation results. To find the best solution, a combination of different
strategies has been examined and finally implemented in 19 different
scenario in three aspects including initial scenarios, drought conditions
and strategies comparisons. A comparison of the conditions of resources
in these scenarios with the current conditions continuing during the five
years of simulation is shown in Fig. 12, and Table 4 reviews all the
scenarios with cost/income details. In every scenario with a fixed price
change, the price increases to a certain extent every month, and this
change is the same for everyone. In dynamic pricing, however, the price
change is based on the proposed formula, calculated separately for each
household. Based on the formulation, if the consumption increases, the

price will increase exponentially; a fine has been predicted in the pricing
formula. Also, if the household consumption is low, the price will be
reduced to zero.
3.2. Initial scenarios
a. The current conditions
Resource capacity indicates the groundwater resources sustainability
index as the main goal of this paper. The sustainability of groundwater
resources will be disrupted if the capacity of water resources is less than
20 million cubic meters. In the current trend, Dehno will face problems
and crises from the 30th month onwards.
b. Static pricing: a fixed increase in the price every month
In this scenario, the price of water should be increased just slightly
each month so as not to put pressure on households. Therefore, this
scenario is very useful for financing the current expenses and increasing
the company’s revenues, but it does not lead to reduced consumption
and, thus, to the sustainability of water resources. Its failure to reduce
consumption is due to paying no attention to fines and incentives; as a
result, it cannot change the behavior of subscribers. According to the
ABFA consumption data, when water prices increased, consumption
reduced in four months, but it then returned to its original state. Ac­
cording to ABFA experts, this may be due to the low price increase and

lack of price elasticity considerations.
c. NRW control and households monitoring
This includes monitoring the households, controlling the network
against theft, fixing the old networks, repairing breakdowns rapidly, and
reducing the network loss. In this regard, household monitoring means
to prevent the manipulation of metering devices and network theft. This
requires the use of technology and power and is not possible without
investment. According to the ABFA experts, with such monitoring, the
rate of consumption is reduced by 2% each month for one year and the
budget required in each month is 50 million Rials. This budget must be
offset by pricing. In this scenario, pricing is based on fixed and periodic
(monthly) increases (SP scenario).
d. Rationing and limiting the consumption with smart meters

In this scenario, water consumption is controlled using smart meters.
The service provider controls these meters remotely. Each family is
assigned a daily allowance based on the number of members and the
history of consumption. If the consumption reaches the threshold, the
automatic meter is cut off and only a small amount of water passes
through it. The cost of this task must be offset by pricing. In this scenario,
pricing is based on fixed and periodic (monthly) increases (as in the SP
scenario). The cost of a smart meter for each household is 10 million
Rials, and the number of replacements per month is determined based
on the company’s revenue.
e. Awareness and Culture
This scenario has to do with the awareness-raising, educating and
informing of the households about the conditions of water resources and
9

how to conserve them. According to the experts at the local water supply
company, this task costs 50 thousand Rials per household per month and
the savings in each month is 2%, but the results are not measurable in
the long run. The cost must be offset by pricing, which, in this scenario,
is based on fixed and monthly increases (as in the SP scenario)
f. Dynamic pricing þ NRW control
In this section, scenario M is implemented with dynamic pricing,
which is the method of pricing proposed in this study. The average price
change in dynamic pricing is the same as fixed price change, but the
revenue is almost doubled. This is because the income is accrued
through fines and exponential bill change on high-consumption
households.
g. Dynamic pricing þ NRW control þ Awareness
In this scenario, a combination of the previous scenarios is used
along with awareness. According to the experts at the service-providing
company, promoting the culture and education of households requires
less NRW control, so the investment is dedicated to them.
h. Dynamic pricing þ NRW control þ Awareness þ Rationing
Dynamic pricing serves to cover the inevitable costs by combining
NRW control, culture and rationing. This method has the best efficiency
to balance the consumption and the sustainability of water resources,
but the main problem is that it requires more investment than the other
methods. The needed funds must be offset either by high prices, through
government assistance, or in a smart manner over time. But what is
needed for culture building if rationing is done? To answer this question,
the following points can be considered:

crisis, the conditions will improve a lot, but the region will still be in the
crisis from the 30th month and in hot seasons. Therefore, rationing
policies need to be applied too.
4 Drought condition þ Dynamic pricing þ Awareness þ NRW
control þ Rationing (DPCMR)
This refers to the simultaneous application of consumption control
policies and rations. Using smart control meters, the consumption of all
the subscribers can be reduced by 20 %. As a result, the maximum
allowed consumption is 80 %. In addition, network monitoring and theft
prevention, promotion of households’ education and culture, dynamic
pricing, and implementation of incentives and fines should also be taken
into account when a crisis occurs. As shown in Fig. 12b, in the present
state of affairs, the resources are not in crisis and have some stability.
The question that arises is how to apply consumption control policies
(namely pricing, rationing, monitoring and culture) at the time of crisis.
Also, since practicing these policies is costly, the policies must be
managed by the controlling of the cost. For this purpose, different
combinations of the proposed scenarios have been tested to determine
the best one.
3.4. Comparison of the strategies
As shown in Fig. 12b, the best scenario is the combination of pricing,
rationing, NRW controlling and culturing. The cost of control and
awareness raising comes from the revenue of dynamic pricing. High
prices and rationing may cause social discontent, so they should be
practiced cautiously. To solve this problem, a combination of strategies
(e.g., pricing, rationing, NRW control and culturing), as presented in
Table 3, proves to be the best selection. Since the cost of control is high,
it cannot be implemented at a low price; therefore, the first case (i.e., the
moderate price increase with senior NRW control) has been eliminated.
S1 is not operationally feasible because pricing cannot cover the costs.
Based on Fig. 12c, the best scenario is S2 when the price change takes
place at a medium level through rationing. Also, the control of theft and
wastewater can be done with just a little culture-building. Table 4 pre­
sents a detailed review of the scenarios.

• Dieting leads to implicit dissatisfaction. Whether this dissatisfaction
is expressed with protests or remains mentally (da Silva Monte &
Morais, 2019).
• Because water is not supplied as much as it can be, it may lead to
unauthorized removal of the meter or tampering with it, which, in
turn, leads to further incidents.
• Customers’ awareness about the drought situation helps to raise their
acceptance of measures such as water rationing and dynamic pricing.
Awareness can be a great help to satisfaction and non-disruption
(Michel, 2017).

4. Discussion

Based on Fig. 12a, the best scenario is the one with a minimal loss (i.
e., minimal network leakage, breakdown, accident and theft). In such a
program, the demand is equated with the supply (i.e., a case of equi­
librium) as much as possible. The best scenario is PMCR, or dynamic
pricing with NRW control, household awareness and water rationing.
The last four scenarios contribute to resource sustainability, but their
performance during a drought needs to be examined.

According to the results gained from the scenarios and based on
Fig. 12 and Table 4, there are certain points worth discussing.
• The increase of price alone in the long term has little effect on the
sustainability of water resources. If combined with proper rationing,
however, it yields better results. If prices rise too much or rations
become too tight, local resources are widely used, which decreases
the infiltration of shallow local aquifers into deep drinking water
aquifers. This strategy reduces the resources for a long time, in­
creases the network theft, and reduces the bill payment power.
• According to ABFA experts, low rations do not reduce consumption
because the same amount of water is consumed when the households
are connected to the network. Therefore, rationing should be done
with the help of smart meters, and the water withdrawal of every

3.3. Drought conditions
Since the study area is subject to droughts and is currently in that
condition, different hydro-economic scenarios should be examined in
four conditions as follows:
1 Sustainability in drought conditions
Drought in this study is defined as a 50 % reduction in precipitation.
In this case, as shown in Fig. 12b, from the 18th month, i.e., from the
second half of 2019, the underground resource capacity would be less
than 20 million cubic meters and the region would be in crisis. There­
fore, consumption management policies would have to be applied.
2 Drought condition þ Dynamic pricing
If pricing is applied only as a demand management tool, it will not
work in a crisis and the goal of the study, which is underground resource
sustainability, cannot be met. Therefore, other policies need to be
applied with the revenue from new ways of pricing.
3 Drought condition þ Dynamic pricing þ Awareness þ NRW
control (DPCM)
If consumption control policies, including pricing, awareness and
monitoring of the network and households, are applied in a drought

household should be limited and specific so that it cannot use more
than specified. Also, it induces the idea of water shortage, which may
result in the saving of water.
• Static pricing does not help to reduce consumption, nor does it make
a great difference from the current conditions. It is because price
elasticity is not applied, the households become accustomed to the
constant rise of prices, and they do not change their consumption.
Besides, a steady rise in prices may not reflect drought or wet con­
ditions. Dynamic pricing can solve these problems; the price in­
creases more when the resource stability is at risk, the supplydemand balance is disturbed, or dryness occurs. Likewise, the price
will decrease if the conditions reverse or there is a significant in­
crease in the volume of overflow resources.
• When the revenue generated by rising prices is devoted to awareness
raising and NRW control, the change in resource sustainability is
quite noticeable. This change has been accounted for in the proposed
scenarios, and it has also been reported in the studies of ABFA
experts.
• In a drought condition, if the cost of awareness raising is low or zero,
there are only focuses on NRW control and rise of prices, delayed
consumption savings will occur, and resource volume diagrams will
be initially zeroed and then corrected. This type of change can be
seen in scenarios S2 and S3.
• As the DPCM scenario suggests, one can expect the sustainability of
water resources even in drought conditions without rationing.
However, even in these circumstances, limited rations are suggested.
It both helps the sustainability of the resources and encourages the
idea that resources are limited and running out. This, in turn, pro­
motes the culture of consumption.
• As the results suggest, economic scenarios cannot be efficient
without considering the culture and NRW control factors; every

action within a scenario entails the constant practice of culture and
control.
• S2, S4, S5, and S7 are the top resource sustainability scenarios. Tight
rationing and rising prices, although sustaining the resources, will
lead to widespread public discontent, which will have long-term
consequences. There is no possibility of implementation if the sce­
narios have negative profits (i.e., the costs are more than the in­
come). As a result, S7 and S4 scenarios are also set aside, and S2 and
S5 are recommended. These two scenarios contribute to the sus­
tainability of resources and the maintenance of the relative balance
of supply and demand.
Using the proposed method has a series of advantages and challenges
as follows:
Advantages
• Appropriate method: Each household bill is calculated based on its
consumption history, income, and property size.
• Effectiveness: The proposed method has a significant positive effect
on the reduction of consumption.
• Comprehensiveness: Different factors, including specific conditions,
regions and water resources, are considered in this method.
• Consumption and tax incentives: When water resources are felt to be
adequate, there are incentives for consumption. When there are se­
vere resource constraints, the taxes and duties imposed on the con­
sumption increase exponentially; thus, the price increases
exponentially.
Challenges

• Computational complexity: Due to the use of different strategies,
calculations are complex, and it is unfortunately difficult for the
household to understand.
• Severe sensitivity: Changes in consumption, supply-demand balance,
and resource situation make the prices change suddenly.

Policy implications
Based on the empirical results, certain notes on policymaking can be
presented as follows:
• Rationing not only helps to reduce consumption but also induces the
idea of water shortage, which is a kind of culture-building task.
Therefore, in crisis, it is recommended to cut off the drinking water
network with prior notice at certain times of the day
• One of the most important problems in the region is the use of
drinking water in agriculture, which is due to the drought crisis.
Giving awareness of the water conditions and the imposition of fines
on high-consumption households can be effective strategies. As it
was observed in the studied region, in the short run, awarenessraising had the greatest effect on the reduction of consumption. On
average, the consumption was reduced by 2% in each monthly
period.
• It is recommended to replace the current district meters with smart
meters. The advantages of these meters are consumption flow con­
trol, consumption control, average consumption control per day, and
setting the maximum permissible use.
• Since agricultural uses are part of the domestic uses, it is interesting
to consider water recycling and the reuse of greywater for irrigation
rather than fresh water. Water reuse is quite easy to implement and
of the least cost; it results in considerable savings.
• Water demand for irrigation is much more elastic to changes in water
price. So, water tariffs and monitoring are essential in this area to
accomplish sustainable exploitation.
5. Conclusion
Water allocation depends on exogenous development drivers, eco­
nomic benefits, and the society’s perception of water preferences (Dalcin
& Fernandes Marques, 2020). Hydro-economic models can serve as
valuable tools for the better understanding of water allocation systems
as well as the improvement of decision-making and water resources
management (Alamanos et al., 2019). System dynamics and agent-based
modeling are also powerful tools for resource simulation and integrated
water resource management (Amadei, 2020). This study was conducted
to test certain hydro-economic strategies of managing the drinking
water demand in the village of Dehno in Yazd Province, Iran. The area
has experienced long-term drought and suffered from water shortage. To
enhance the sustainability of groundwater resources in that area under
drought conditions, different scenarios were examined. Dynamic water
pricing formulas were presented and implemented by system dynamics
and agent-based simulation. As prescribed by this pricing system, each
household’s bill is calculated based on the amount of consumption,
consumption pattern, price elasticity and dynamic price. The dynamic
price of water is the same for everyone, but rainfall, rationing and
resource volume affect it.
As a result, both water economy and consumer awareness should be
considered in water pricing. The scenarios that were performed in this
regard were able to meet the goal of the research, which was to achieve
the sustainability of groundwater resources. The best scenario in
drought conditions was a combination of medium dynamic price in­
crease, control the consumption with rations and smart meters, and
NRW control through network modification and household monitoring.

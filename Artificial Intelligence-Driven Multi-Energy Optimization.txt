Abstract: This research contributes to the overarching objectives of achieving carbon neutrality
and enhancing environmental governance by examining the role of artificial intelligence-enhanced
multi-energy optimization in rural energy planning within the broader context of a sustainable
energy economy. By proposing an innovative planning framework that accounts for geographical and
economic disparities across rural regions, this study specifically targets the optimization of energy
systems in X County of Yantai City, Y County of Luoyang City, and Z County of Lanzhou City. Furthermore, it establishes a foundation for integrating these localized approaches into broader national
carbon-neutral efforts and assessments of green total factor productivity. The comparative analysis of
energy demand, conservation, efficiency, and economic metrics among these counties underscores
the potential of tailored solutions to significantly advance low-carbon practices in agriculture, urban development, and industry. Additionally, the insights derived from this study offer a deeper
understanding of the dynamics between government and enterprise in environmental governance,
empirically supporting the Porter hypothesis, which postulates that stringent environmental policies
can foster innovation and competitiveness. The rural coal-coupled biomass power generation model
introduced in this work represents the convergence of green economy principles and financial systems, serving as a valuable guide for decision-making in decisions aimed at sustainable consumption
and production. Moreover, this research underscores the importance of resilient and adaptable energy
systems, proposing a pathway for evaluating emission trading markets and promoting sustainable
economic recovery strategies that align with environmental sustainability goals.

1. Introduction

Accepted: 8 May 2024

With the ascendancy of sustainable energy, clean sources such as solar, wind, and
hydropower are progressively emerging as primary alternatives to traditional energy
sources. However, the instability and intermittency of these renewable energy sources
pose challenges to the reliability and stability of energy systems [1]. Simultaneously, there
is an increasing global call for promoting energy transition. To enhance the efficiency of
renewable energy utilization and mitigate the environmental burden of energy production
and consumption, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has emerged [2–4]. The application
of AI in the energy field can be broadly categorized into several aspects. First, AI can
optimize energy production plans and enhance energy production efficiency by employing
advanced data analysis and prediction algorithms in the energy production process. Second,
AI can play a pivotal role in energy storage and distribution, facilitating efficient energy
utilization through intelligent management. Additionally, AI can provide innovative

solutions on the energy consumption side, reduce energy waste through technologies such
as smart homes and intelligent transportation, and promote the intelligent transformation
of energy consumption.
The world is facing serious environmental challenges, of which climate change is
one of the most prominent. According to the United Nations Environment Programme,
global average temperatures have risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius since industrialization,
leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, with serious
impacts on ecosystems and human societies [5]. At the same time, there is an imbalance
between energy supply and demand around the world, which has led to over-reliance
on traditional energy resources, exacerbating the negative impact on the environment.
According to the International Energy Agency, global energy demand is continuing to grow
and is expected to increase by 25% by 2030, with the majority of energy demand relying
on fossil fuels [6]. This unbalanced energy mix has led to a continuous increase in carbon
emissions, exacerbating the problem of climate change and environmental pollution.
In response to these environmental challenges, the application of AI in energy planning
has great potential and advantages, especially in the field of rural energy planning. In
China, for example, energy supply in rural areas faces many challenges, including unstable
supply and low energy efficiency. AI technology can optimize the energy supply structure
and improve energy utilization efficiency through the analysis and prediction of big data,
thus reducing carbon emissions and environmental pollution. Miskat et al. [7] proposed
that by using AI technology to optimize energy planning, intelligent management of energy
consumption could be realized in rural areas and energy costs could be saved. Moreover,
energy utilization efficiency could be improved, and sustainable development of the local
economy could be promoted [7]. AI technology can also predict and respond to variations
in energy demand, adjust the energy supply structure in advance, and ensure the stability
and sustainability of the energy supply. Therefore, the widespread application of AI
technology in rural energy planning is of great significance for achieving carbon neutrality
and promoting the green transition.
The widespread application of renewable energy represents an effective strategy for alleviating energy crises and reducing environmental impacts [8–10]. However, the planning
and operation of energy systems face unprecedented complexity due to the uncertainty
of renewable energy. This circumstance mandates the continual exploration of innovative
solutions aimed at optimizing both the structure and operation of energy systems, thereby
augmenting their adaptability to a wide range of energy sources. Conventional energy
systems typically revolve around the production and utilization of a singular energy source,
whereas multi-energy coupling systems integrate diverse forms of energy, including solar, wind, and biomass, fostering a complementary and synergistic energy usage. This
system integration elevates energy efficiency and bolsters the system’s resilience to risk,
ultimately rendering the energy system more flexible and sustainable. As an emerging
trend, BIOMASS-coal coupling technology injects new vitality into energy transition [11,12].
Combining biomass energy with traditional coal systems can mitigate the adverse environmental effects of fossil fuel use and potentially improve the efficiency of coal-fire power
generation. With the incorporation of AI technology, biomass-coal coupling systems can
intelligently regulate the blend ratio of biomass and coal, thereby realizing a more flexible
and sustainable power generation mode [13,14].
This study aims to conduct an in-depth investigation into the simulation of energy
system planning integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) and the optimization of multienergy coupling, with a specific emphasis on the application of biomass-coal coupling
technology. Through systematic research, the objective is to present innovative solutions
aimed at enhancing the efficient operation of energy systems, reducing environmental
impacts, and providing significant scientific foundations for building a sustainable energy
economy. By exploring the application of AI in the energy sector, this study strives to identify intelligent, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible solutions for the upcoming
energy transition.

This work not only provides theoretical support and practical guidance for rural
energy planning and energy transition, but also offers new thinking and ways for achieving
sustainable development goals and environmental governance. By exploring the role of
AI-enhanced multi-energy optimization in rural energy planning, this work affords a new
perspective and method for achieving carbon neutrality and enhancing environmental
governance. In addition, an innovative planning scheme has been proposed that takes into
account the geographical and economic differences in rural areas and provides specific
solutions for the optimization of energy systems in different areas, helping to promote the
development of a sustainable energy economy. A comparative analysis of energy demand,
conservation, efficiency, and economic indicators across different counties shows the potential to contribute low-carbon practices to agriculture, urban development, and industry
domains. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of government–business
interactions in environmental governance, thereby corroborating Porter’s hypothesis, which
posits that stringent environmental regulations have the potential to stimulate innovation
and enhance competitiveness. A coupled coal-biomass power generation model in rural
areas demonstrates the integration of green economy principles with the financial system,
offering a valuable reference for planning decisions aimed at sustainable consumption and
production. The importance of building resilient energy systems is emphasized, and a
pathway is provided for evaluating emissions trading markets and promoting sustainable
economic recovery strategies aligned with environmental sustainability goals. Through
empirical research and model construction, this work provides a scientific basis for rural
energy system planning, especially in the development characteristics and energy demand
of different regions in eastern, central, and western China. These results are closely related
to current policies and give an important reference for future policy formulation, especially
in promoting the development of rural energy systems in a clean, low-carbon, and efficient
direction. This work explores the relationship between air pollution control and housing
price stability and furnishes a new perspective for the development of comprehensive
environmental management strategies. The potential of solar photovoltaic and wind power
generation projects is evaluated, and strategies and suggestions are provided for promoting
green transformation and improving energy efficiency in western regions such as Z County.
2. Literature Review
In the pursuit of energy transition efficiency, AI technology plays a pivotal role due to
its ability to process big data and optimize complex systems intelligently. Through big data
analysis, potential energy wastage and bottlenecks can be identified, providing valuable
data support for the optimization of energy production and consumption. Simultaneously,
AI’s deep learning algorithms are capable of recognizing patterns within vast datasets,
thereby facilitating the intelligent control and management of energy systems.
Liu et al. [15] emphasized the utility of AI technology in predicting and optimizing
renewable energy sources (particularly wind and solar energy) in the context of energy
production. Through the forecasting of energy output and adapting production plans
accordingly, AI has the potential to enhance energy production efficiency by continuously
monitoring weather conditions and the status of energy production equipment. Tutak
et al. [16] highlighted that intelligent power system management was a significant application area of AI technology in energy production. AI could optimize power system
operations by monitoring grid loads and equipment conditions in real-time to improve the
power supply’s stability and reliability.
Countries and regions globally are formulating and updating energy plans to balance
economic growth and environmentally sustainable development. Nishant et al. [17] suggested that combining biomass energy with traditional coal systems could result in cleaner
and more efficient energy utilization. The widespread adoption of this technology can
become a crucial means of reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency
in the future. The application of AI technology in biomass-coal coupling systems also
has significant potential, allowing for intelligent control of biomass and coal to enhance

Sustainability 2024, 16, 4111

overall system performance. In energy storage and distribution, AI can be applied to
battery technology, smart connected charging stations, and other areas to achieve efficient
storage and distribution of electric power. Vanegas Cantarero [18] proposed that AI could
extend battery life and enhance energy storage efficiency through intelligent management
of battery charging and discharging processes. In power distribution, AI can enhance
system flexibility and adaptability by intelligently adjusting power distribution schemes
based on real-time monitoring of grid loads and predicting electricity demand.
Wang et al. [19] focused on the risk prediction and credibility detection of network public opinion (NPO) and used blockchain technology for optimization. They employed smart
contracts to establish an NPO risk management system and tracked public opinion using
risk correlation tree technology. Their research findings revealed that, under blockchain
technology, the three experimental schemes designed could accurately predict the risk of
NPO and assess its credibility, aligning with the objectives of this study. Deng et al. [20]
evaluated the economic resilience of coal resource-based cities under low-carbon economic
growth conditions. They enhanced the vitality of the economic market in resource-based
cities by promoting public participation mechanisms through increased government policy
intervention. The findings revealed that from 2011 to 2021, the economic resilience levels of traditional cities and coal resource-based cities fluctuated and increased. In 2011,
the economic resilience indices of traditional cities and coal resource-based cities were
0.11 and 0.22, respectively. By 2021, the economic resilience assessment stabilities of the
two cities were 0.527 and 0.562, respectively. Li et al. [21] discovered that pilot policies in
low-carbon cities generally inhibited enterprise activities, but the level of green innovation
could alleviate this inhibitory effect. Through heterogeneity analysis, they found that
these pilot policies had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on enterprise activities in
central and western regions, resource-based cities, and non-central cities. Furthermore, the
pilot policy hindered enterprise activities in high-carbon industries while promoting those
in emerging industries, resulting in industrial structural transformations and upgrades.
Li et al. [22] implemented a corresponding clean energy development path and ecological
environment sustainable development analysis model based on big data technology. They
evaluated the feasibility and potential benefits of promoting and applying clean energy
in mining projects. The results indicated that under varying GDP growth rates, the new
and cumulative installed capacity of global wind energy exhibited an increasing trend. It
is anticipated that new wind capacity will increase significantly by 2030 with economic
growth. The reduction in CO2 emissions will continue to increase through 2060. Li et al. [23]
studied the impact of climate change on corporate environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) performance. Based on the empirical results, they found that climate change significantly inhibited corporate ESG performance. Meanwhile, they discovered that continued
elimination of internal and external resource misallocation could help mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on ESG performance. In addition, compared to enterprises
in non-resource-based cities, climate change significantly improved the corporate ESG
performance of the resource-based city, indicating that the adaptive behavior caused by
climate change partially broke the resource curse phenomenon. Furthermore, mature
and large enterprises could better mitigate negative impacts, and external pressures from
the public environment and analyst attention can motivate enterprises to improve their
ESG performance. Wang et al. [24] established various time frames by implementing an
iterative process of data platform management and evaluated the impact of three models
using indicators such as public participation and government satisfaction. The research
results illustrated that the combination of data platform management and multi-model
methods effectively enhanced the anti-corruption and prevention capabilities of grassroots
governments, offering inspiration for establishing transparent and efficient grassroots
governance. Li et al. [25] contended that intellectual property pledge financing hindered
corporate innovation, particularly in terms of innovation quality. However, this model can
be overturned by elevating the threshold for innovation conditions. The rationale behind
this is that stringent innovation criteria may result in enterprises having weaker innovation

However, this model can be overturned by elevating the threshold for innovation conditions.

Rural energy development in China can be categorized into three types based on
geographical location: eastern, central, and western regions, each exhibiting distinct development scenarios as outlined in Table 1. The eastern region, situated along the coast with
a low elevation, experiences short winters, high temperatures throughout the year, and
abundant rainfall. Some coastal areas benefit from good year-round sunlight and distinct
monsoons, making the construction of complementary wind and solar energy systems
highly efficient. These areas are at the forefront of national development. Leveraging their

Sustainability 2024, 16, 4111

exceptional geographical and climatic advantages, they have established a robust industrial
and agricultural base, playing a pivotal role in the national economy. Primarily relying on
industrial development to drive their economies, these regions have witnessed significant
progress in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, coupled with abundant
biomass energy resources. These regions have relatively well-established power grids,
enabling the active promotion of renewable energy transformation and encouraging the
use of clean energy such as natural gas [30].

Agriculture, industry, and other sectors are
developing rapidly, resulting in high energy
consumption.
The energy infrastructure is relatively lagging
behind.

The energy is diversified, with
electricity and natural gas as the
primary sources.
They possess natural renewable energy
sources with minimal energy loss.

Economic development is fast, and there is
relatively low demand for heating.
The power grid is relatively well-developed,
with some areas having heating needs.
The northwest region experiences cold winters,
while the southwest region has a mild climate.

Solar energy resources are moderate,
with a focus on developing clean
energy.
Abundant straw resources drive the
centralized utilization of biomass.
Solar, wind, and other renewable
energy sources are clean and abundant.

The central region has a moderate climate, with most areas being plains surrounded
by plateaus and hills. Rural electrification infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with
electricity being the main energy source [31–33]. With longer average sunlight hours,
photovoltaic units can serve as distributed power sources for local users. These areas
should continue to promote the construction of energy systems centered around electricity
while upgrading and improving weak power grids.
Western rural areas can be divided into southwest and northwest types. The southwest region has a mild climate with hot and rainy summers and is rich in hydropower
and solar resources. It is suitable for developing hydropower projects and distributed
photovoltaic power systems. The northwest region experiences cold winters, relatively
late development, limited transportation conditions, and an overall lower development
level. Despite abundant renewable energy resources, there is potential to develop energy
systems based mainly on renewable energy sources. In summary, some areas in the western
region have abundant renewable energy resources but struggle to efficiently utilize local
renewable resources due to economic constraints. These areas need to focus on improving
power infrastructure while addressing the conversion issues of local renewable energy
resources. Scenarios of differentiated energy development in various areas are exhibited in
Table 1.
3.2. Energy System Planning Models with the Coupling of Different Energy Sources
Biomass, such as straw and sawdust, can be obtained through agricultural and forestry
resources, while coal is a traditional and reliable energy source. Coupling these two types
of energy can effectively utilize renewable resources while maintaining the energy system’s
stability. The advantage of the bio coal combined unit lies in its stability and reliability.
Compared to a single energy source, the combination of biomass and coal can balance
energy supply and reduce dependence on specific energy sources. This is particularly
important for rural areas, especially considering the impact of climate and the seasons
on energy demand. However, when exploring the combination of bio coal and other
sustainable energy models, it is necessary to recognize that there may be differences in
environmental impacts across various regions. Especially in the western regions of China,

Sustainability 2024, 16, 4111

7 of 20

the combination of bio coal and pure coal models may have varying degrees of impact
on the local environment. For example, in the northwest region, due to the harsh climate
conditions and geographical limitations, the pure coal model may lead to more serious
air pollution problems and may have adverse effects on local water resources and soil.
In the southwest region, a coal combination may be more suitable, but its impact on the
local ecosystem also needs to be carefully evaluated. Therefore, regarding energy system
planning and environmental governance, it is required to comprehensively consider the
characteristics and environmental impacts of diverse regions and take corresponding
measures to mitigate potential negative impacts. Future research can further explore the
environmental effects of different energy models in the western region and propose targeted
environmental management suggestions to promote sustainable energy development and
environmental protection.
When optimizing capacity configuration, it is essential to consider the characteristics
of energy demand in areas. By establishing demand prediction models based on historical
data and meteorological conditions, the seasonal variations in electricity and heat demand
can be more accurately estimated, providing a practical basis for subsequent optimization.
The construction of a capacity optimization configuration model is a crucial step [34–36].
System efficiency can be maximized through mathematical planning methods. It can
ensure that the capacity of biomass-coal coupling units meets demand while maintaining
the economic and environmental sustainability of the system. This process requires a
comprehensive consideration of the reliability of the biomass supply chain, the upgrading
of coal technology, and the scheduling strategy of the system.
The overall planning of energy systems, as opposed to the independent operation of
individual energy systems, is effective in dealing with various energy complementarity
and coupling relationships [37]. This integrated planning can overcome the limitations of
separate planning for heterogeneous energy sources, significantly improving the energy
utilization efficiency within the region and enhancing the overall efficiency of the energy
system. In overall planning, addressing the coupling relationship of various energies within
the energy system is one of the key issues. The energy hub is abstracted to an input-output
port model that describes the energy conversion and storage relationships between sources,
networks, loads, and storage in the energy system [38–40]. The black box model in Figure 2
is employed, where the black box part is considered as the multi-energy flow system to
be analyzed and characterized through the energy hub. In this model, vector P represents
energy input and vector L represents energy output. This modeling approach is highly

of the data. This work utilizes a grey prediction model to forecast electricity consumption
in rural areas to help understand the changing trend of energy demand in various areas.
The grey model is characterized by its relatively simple structure, low sample quantity
requirement, and suitability for short- to medium-term predictions. Given the specificity of
load forecasting, it is considered particularly suitable for load forecasting, where historical
data are limited and the data structure is relatively uniform. According to Wu et al. [41]’s
water quality prediction method combined with an autoregressive integrated moving
average and clustering model and Yang and Ran [42]’s study on China’s carbon emission
prediction and its driving factors [41], the prediction accuracy of the grey model is higher
when the historical data is small. However, when faced with long time series data, the
fitting effect may decrease because the model may not be able to fully capture the complex
long-term trends and fluctuations between the data.
To further enhance the prediction model’s accuracy, this work incorporates some
optimization measures into the grey model. First, a sliding average method is employed to
smooth the data fluctuations for the first-fit data. Second, a quadratic fitting method is introduced to make the predicted values closer to the actual situation, enhancing the model’s
fitting capability. Lastly, to account for the influence of external factors, a policy fluctuation
term is introduced to consider potential interfering factors more comprehensively.

Due to the complexity of real-world data conditions, using a large amount of data directly may result in significant errors. To mitigate the impact of outliers, it is recommended
to apply a moving average to the original sequence before constructing the exponential
growth sequence, as shown in Equation (6):
x (n) =

x (n − 1) + 2x (n) + x (n + 1)

x (n) represents the original data values.
In order to enhance prediction accuracy, a second-order fitting is performed on the
forecast data of the grey model. The exponential growth model for the first fit is:

The policy volatility term is expressed as:

(10)

x (t) is the exponential function obtained after fitting, A represents the volatility
amplitude, and F (t) refers to the policy affiliation function.
After obtaining the results of exponential growth through second-order fitting, the
policy volatility term is incorporated, and its focus is on the subsequent prediction section.
Coupled biomass and coal units play a significant role in energy planning, providing a
feasible option to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact [43,44]. The
development of a capacity planning model aims to optimize the configuration of these units
to meet the growing energy demands in areas. The first step involves preprocessing energy
load data, considering the impact of policy factors on the load. The model is then used to
obtain the total capacity of biomass gasification furnaces [45–47]. In this step, the model

Machine learning also plays a crucial role in optimizing energy production and distribution. Machine learning systems can identify potential performance issues by continuously monitoring and analyzing real-time operational data from energy production
equipment, improving equipment efficiency and effectiveness. Genetic programming (GP),
as an advanced evolutionary algorithm, utilizes natural selection principles to optimize
problem solutions. Niazkar et al. [48] used multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) and
artificial neural network (ANN) to downscale three general circulation models. Among
them, the GP model demonstrated strong capabilities in dealing with large amounts of data
and complex correlations between variables, making it particularly suitable in the energy
system configuration and optimization fields [49]. GP is an AI evolutionary algorithm that
simulates the natural evolution process to gradually evolve programs or structures adapted
to specific problems. GP provides an innovative approach to optimizing the structure and
configuration of energy systems. In the GP algorithm, individuals are typically represented
by tree structures where each node of the tree represents an operator or variable. The tree
can be expressed through a string of symbols (genetic encoding). The encoding method is
as follows:
I = (o, T1 , T2 )
(11)
I represents an individual, o means the operator at the root node of the tree, T1 and T2
are the left and right subtrees of the tree, respectively.
The fitness function evaluates the performance of an individual and is typically defined
based on the objectives and constraints of the problem. It can be expressed as:
F( I ) =

1
1 + error ( I )

(12)

F ( I ) refers to the fitness of the individual I, and error ( I ) represents the error or
inadaptability of the individual in the solution space.
GP autonomously generates programs that fit specific objectives by simulating the
biological evolution process. In energy systems, GP can be employed to optimize the
structure and configuration of energy systems, enhancing the system’s overall efficiency.

City, situated in eastern China; Y County in Luoyang City, located in central China; and Z
County in Lanzhou City, situated in western China. These regions epitomize China’s rural
energy development landscape, encapsulating the nuances of rural energy systems across
distinct geographical and economic spectra. The selection of these regions is predicated on
their capacity to exemplify the diversity and intricacies of energy development in China,
thus facilitating a comprehensive appraisal of the challenges and opportunities inherent
in rural energy planning and management. The dataset pertaining to these regions exhibits a high degree of representativeness, thereby efficaciously underpinning the empirical
analysis of energy system planning and optimization. Aligned with the research inquiry’s
pertinence, this work aims to investigate avenues for advancing rural energy planning and
fostering sustainable energy economy development through AI-facilitated multi-energy
optimization. Consequently, the chosen data is intricately intertwined with the research
question, enabling a nuanced examination of energy demand, supply structure, economic
attributes, and environmental ramifications across diverse regions. By scrutinizing these
data, a more profound comprehension of the prevailing state and extant challenges within
the energy system can be attained, thereby furnishing a scientific framework for the formulation of efficacious energy planning strategies and policies. As such, it is posited that
the selected data holds significant relevance to the discourse surrounding the research
questions and augments the credibility and persuasiveness of the research findings.
4. Experimental Design and Performance Evaluation
4.1. Scenario Case Analysis Experiment
Based on project data support, this study selected three regions in China (located in the
eastern, central, and western parts) for a detailed case analysis due to their differentiated
development patterns. These regions specifically include X County in Yantai City (east), Y
County in Luoyang City (central), and Z County in Lanzhou City (west). These areas are
chosen as representative validation scenarios, enabling an in-depth examination of various
facets of energy development and establishing a substantial case foundation. Since only X
County and Y County are suitable for combining coal and biomass in power generation,
we have compiled the relevant optimization configuration parameters for this coupling
(Table 2). Given that the selected simulation objects cover economically developed stages
in X and Y counties, it can be understood that these areas, influenced by national policies,
belong to the new agricultural development stage and have made significant progress,
making them representative of the new model. This development status underscores the
significant impact of adjustments in energy transition policies on their progress.

In the modeling process of grey forecasting, the accuracy of the forecast results do not
necessarily increase with the increase in historical data. For optimal results, this study opts
to utilize eight datasets for forecasting, specifically focusing on electricity consumption

from 2014 to 2022. Figures 5 and 6 depict the electricity consumption prediction data
for X and Y counties. Observations indicate that X County’s three primary industries
are flourishing, with agriculture forming a smaller part of its economic structure. The
growth rate in such areas remains at a high level in multiple periods but fails to consistently
sustain the same level of growth. Y County’s development is primarily dominated by
agriculture, and compared to areas like X County, the effects of transformation policies
are more pronounced. The electricity consumption in X County is significantly higher
than that in Y County. The decision for Y County to expand its biomass coal coupling
scale or explore alternative energy development paths hinges on several considerations. If

In this work, X, Y, and Z counties are taken as research cases, and there are obvious
differences in their positioning and main influencing factors in sustainable energy planning.
A breakdown of each county follows:
1.

X County:

Principal Influencing Factors: the level of industrial and agricultural development and
energy consumption efficiency constitute the primary determinants. X County exhibits a
relatively advanced industrial and agricultural landscape, rendering energy consumption
efficiency a paramount consideration. Given the substantial contributions of industrial
and agricultural sectors to energy consumption, enhancing energy utilization efficiency
assumes critical importance in mitigating carbon emissions and fostering sustainable development. Accordingly, X County may prioritize the adoption of energy-saving and
emission-reduction technologies to enhance energy efficiency across industrial and agricultural domains. Simultaneously, the gradual integration of renewable energy sources to
supplant conventional energy sources facilitates the transformation and modernization of
the energy structure. Environmental Impact Considerations: owing to the mature development of industry and agriculture, X County exerts a notable environmental footprint.
Consequently, imperative environmental conservation measures, such as curbing energy
consumption, reducing carbon emissions, and ameliorating air quality emerge as pivotal
facets guiding future developmental trajectories.
2.

Y County:

Principal Influencing Factors: agricultural dependence and utilization of renewable
energy. The economic structure of Y County is mainly based on agriculture, so more
attention is paid to the utilization of renewable energy. The biomass resources generated
during agricultural production can serve as a critical source of renewable energy. Hence, in
energy planning, Y County attaches greater importance to the development and utilization
of renewable energy. Y County may be more inclined to develop renewable energy projects
such as agricultural waste utilization and biomass energy to meet the energy needs of
agricultural production and residents and achieve sustainable development of rural energy.
The industrial structure of Y County is mainly based on agriculture, and compared to
industrialized areas, its impact on the environment is relatively small. However, attention
still needs to focus on potential environmental issues that may arise during agricultural
production processes, such as pesticide residues and land degradation.
3.

Z County:

Principal Influencing Factors: economic development level and environmental protection demand. Z County is located in the western region of China, with a comparatively
low level of economic development. Thus, in energy planning, more emphasis is placed
on balancing economic development and environmental protection. With the increasing
awareness of environmental protection, the demand for environmental protection is gradually increasing, becoming a vital factor affecting energy planning. Z County may take
measures such as developing clean energy and improving energy utilization efficiency to
achieve sustainable economic growth while protecting local environmental resources. Due
to the relatively low level of economic development, the environmental protection needs
in Z County are more urgent. Consequently, in energy planning, it is necessary to pay
attention to environmental protection measures such as reducing pollution emissions and
improving resource utilization efficiency to achieve a win-win situation between economic
development and environmental protection.
4.3. Explanation of Model Results and Policy Relevance
The capacity planning model proposed here is closely related to current policies,
and its output is in line with the local policy background, furnishing critical references
for future policy formulation. Taking China’s rural energy planning as an example, the
current Chinese government has proposed the strategic goals of carbon neutrality and
sustainable development. It requires improving energy utilization efficiency, promoting

Sustainability 2024, 16, 4111

15 of 20

energy structure optimization and upgrading, vigorously developing clean and renewable
energy sources, and reducing carbon emissions while achieving energy supply security.
The proposed model is based on this background, aiming to realize an intelligent and
sustainable energy supply by optimizing the energy supply structure.
Drawing from the model outcomes, prospective energy planning initiatives should
center on the following focal points. Firstly, optimizing the energy supply structure and
augmenting the utilization of clean and renewable energy resources warrant concerted
attention. Tailored energy transition pathways can be delineated for diverse rural settings to
propel the energy system toward cleaner, low-carbon, and efficient trajectories. For instance,
initiatives can entail bolstering the utilization of clean energy sources like solar and wind
energy, alongside fostering the incremental integration of renewable energy within rural
energy matrices, contingent upon local climatic prerequisites. Secondly, deliberations
should ensue on strategies to expedite the adoption of renewable energy and realize carbon
neutrality objectives within prevailing policy frameworks. Governments can incentivize
corporate entities and individuals to amplify investments in and utilization of renewable
energy through proactive policy interventions, including subsidies, preferential tax regimes,
and the establishment of carbon markets, thereby advancing the transition toward carbon
neutrality. Finally, fortifying the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms about the efficacy
of energy planning implementation and promptly recalibrating policy interventions as
warranted assumes paramount importance. By instituting a robust monitoring framework
and collating data pertaining to energy utilization and environmental indicators, the efficacy
of energy planning implementation can be judiciously appraised. Furthermore, policy
adjustments are orchestrated in a timely fashion based on evaluation outcomes to ensure
the seamless attainment of energy planning objectives.
In short, future energy planning should strengthen measures regarding policy support,
technological innovation, market mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation. Consequently, it can promote the rural energy system’s development in a cleaner, more efficient,
and sustainable direction, and make positive contributions to the realization of carbon
neutrality and sustainable development goals.
4.4. Strategies to Stabilize Housing Prices for Particle Matter and Air Pollution
This work recognizes the close relationship between air pollution control and stable housing prices and realizes that this relationship is crucial for achieving sustainable
development goals. Specifically, it should be noted that housing price policies have a
significant impact on residents’ housing choices and lifestyles, which in turn directly affect
energy consumption and emissions. Therefore, it is believed that exploring the impact of
housing price policies on particle matter (PM) emissions and air quality, as well as their
correlation with air pollution control, is of great significance for formulating comprehensive
environmental governance strategies.
Firstly, the impact of housing price policies on urban planning and land use can
be analyzed. High housing prices may lead residents to choose to purchase housing in
suburbs or places far from the city center, thereby increasing commuting distance and
further increasing car exhaust emissions. Thus, the reasonable regulation of housing
price policies can indirectly affect the frequency of car use and reduce PM emissions by
influencing residents’ choices of living locations. Secondly, housing price policies may also
affect residents’ investment in energy utilization and environmental protection facilities.
In cities with high housing prices, residents may be more inclined to purchase newly
built high-end housing, which is often equipped with more efficient energy utilization
facilities and environmentally friendly equipment, thereby reducing energy consumption
and emissions. Hence, the adjustment of the housing price policy may indirectly affect the
energy structure of the city and the construction level of environmental protection facilities,
and then affect the air quality. Finally, housing price policies may also affect the economic
status and lifestyle of residents, thereby affecting their level of attention to environmental
issues. The rise in housing prices may lead residents to pay more attention to conservation

Sustainability 2024, 16, 4111

and environmental protection, such as choosing to purchase energy-saving appliances and
reducing energy waste. These behaviors have a positive effect on reducing PM emissions
and improving air quality.
According to the above analysis, it is suggested that future research should further
explore the relationship between housing price policy and environmental governance,
and put forward targeted policy recommendations. For example, the government can
guide residents to choose more environmentally friendly living methods and promote
green urban development by adjusting housing price policies. The government can also
encourage developers to use more environmentally friendly building materials and facilities
in new residential buildings by formulating incentive policies, thus reducing the impact of
construction on the environment. These policy measures help achieve the dual goals of
air pollution control and stable housing prices and promote the development of cities in a
more sustainable direction.
4.5. Potential and Challenges of Solar Photovoltaic and Wind Power Generation Projects
Considering the abundant renewable energy resources in Z County and the entire
western region, especially the significant potential in solar and wind energy, the research
scope has been expanded and the comprehensive optimization allocation of these resources
has been evaluated. Utilizing an analytical framework analogous to the biomass-coal
coupling model, we have conducted the planning and design of solar photovoltaic and
wind power generation systems in Z County, evaluating their stability, economic viability,
and environmental implications within the local context. It is believed that although
Z County cannot adopt the biomass coal coupling model, there is still broad space in
promoting green transformation and improving energy efficiency in the region.
In Z County, an innovative model for the comprehensive utilization of solar and wind
energy is adopted, utilizing geographic information systems (GIS) and multi-objective
optimization technology to determine the optimal installation location for solar photovoltaic
panels and wind turbines. This model considers terrain, sunshine rate, wind speed, and
other factors to ensure the maximization of energy output and cost-benefit optimization.
The average annual sunshine hours in Z County reach 2200 h, with an average wind
speed of 3.5 m per second, providing good conditions for solar and wind energy. Based
on geographical analysis, photovoltaic panels are chosen to be installed in the southern
region with open terrain and sufficient sunlight. The expected installation capacity is
150 megawatts. Wind turbines are mainly installed in the northern mountainous areas
with high wind speeds, with an expected installation capacity of 100 megawatts. The
preliminary results of the comprehensive energy system planning are presented in Table 3.
In Z County, considering the lack of combined utilization of biomass coal, planning
experiments are carried out on solar and wind energy resources. For solar and wind power
generation projects, the following strategies have been adopted. Firstly, a geographical
survey and resource assessment are conducted on these projects. By collecting and analyzing climate data, topography, and other information about Z County, suitable locations
for constructing projects are determined. Secondly, the layout and capacity of solar photovoltaic and wind power generation systems are designed. Based on the results of the
field survey and resource assessment, the location and number of photovoltaic panels
and wind turbines are determined to maximize the use of local solar and wind resources.
Finally, an operation and maintenance plan is developed. Considering the seasonality
and uncertainty of solar and wind energy, an operation and maintenance plan has been
developed to ensure the stable operation and effective utilization of solar photovoltaic and
wind power generation systems.
Solar and wind power generation projects can bring many benefits to Z County. Solar
photovoltaic and wind power generation systems can provide Z County with a clean,
renewable energy supply, decrease dependence on traditional energy sources, and reduce
environmental pollution. The construction of these projects can create employment opportunities and promote local economic development. At the same time, project operation

Sustainability 2024, 16, 4111

and maintenance drive the development of related industrial chains, forming an industrial
agglomeration effect. The use of clean energy improves the living environment of residents
and enhances their quality of life. In addition, the project construction also promotes local
energy security and advances social stability and sustainable development.

However, these projects’ construction also faces some challenges. Solar photovoltaic
and wind power technologies require advanced equipment and technical support, and the
construction process may face problems such as supply chain disruptions and equipment
failures. These projects require a large amount of capital investment, including equipment
procurement, engineering construction, operation, and maintenance expenses, and the
investment return period is relatively long. Project management and operation require
professionals and experienced teams to carry out. Moreover, facing factors such as weather,
seasonal changes, management, and operation are difficult. To sum up, while solar photovoltaic and wind power projects bring clean energy supply to Z County, they also face
some challenges which need the joint efforts of government departments, enterprises, and
all sectors of society to overcome.
A comparative analysis is carried out and the economic and environmental benefits
of different energy utilization schemes are re-evaluated in response to the development
potential of Z County in renewable energy. Comparative analysis updates and benefit
reassessment are listed in Table 4:

Table 4 shows that although the biomass coal combined utilization scheme has outstanding economic and environmental benefits, considering the lack of biomass resources in
Z County, solar photovoltaic and wind power generation are still more feasible energy utilization schemes. Hence, it is recommended that government departments and enterprises
focus on promoting the construction of solar photovoltaic and wind power generation

projects when formulating energy development plans to achieve a win-win situation of
economic and environmental benefits.
5. Conclusions
This work successfully advances the green transition of rural energy planning and
sustainable energy economy by proposing an innovative AI-based multi-energy optimization model. Case studies of diverse rural areas in eastern, central, and western China
demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in improving energy efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and promoting economic development. The application results of the
model are closely linked with the national carbon neutrality target and the green total factor
productivity assessment, thus providing a scientific basis and practical guidance for energy
system planning.
Policymakers are advised to consider the following measures. The energy supply
structure is optimized, increasing the utilization of clean and renewable energy; Incentive
policies are developed to encourage businesses and individuals to invest in renewable
energy; A monitoring system is established, the effectiveness of energy planning implementation is evaluated, and policies are adjusted promptly. In addition, it is necessary to
recognize the close relationship between air pollution control and housing price stability.
Hence, it is recommended that future research further explore the relationship between
housing price policies and environmental governance.
Although this work has achieved certain results, there are limitations, and future
research can further explore the application of AI technology in the broader rural energy
field and develop more refined models and algorithms. Solar photovoltaic and wind power
generation projects show great potential in Z County, but they also face technical and
financial challenges. Government departments, enterprises, and all sectors of society must
work together to overcome these challenges and promote the green transformation and
sustainable development of rural energy systems.
This work strongly believes that the use of AI and multi-energy optimization strategies
can effectively promote energy planning and transition in rural areas and make a positive
contribution to the achievement of global and Chinese sustainable development goals.
